                    <p>
                        From the funeral March sonata written in the beginning
                        of his middle period, we now jump to what can be
                        considered the final middle-period sonata: the Les
                        Adieux sonata, written in 1809 and 1810. This is unique
                        among his sonatas in that it is explicitly programmatic
                        or that there is a &ldquo;hidden meaning&rdquo; of sorts
                        to the music he wrote, something that he experimented
                        with in the 6th &ldquo;Pastorale&rdquo; symphony as
                        well. The story behind this sonata is related to the
                        Archduke Rudolph, who was a great patron of Beethoven
                        (with important works such as the &ldquo;Archduke
                        Trio&rdquo;, op. 97, the 4th Piano Concerto, op. 58, and
                        the Missa Solemnis, op. 123, all being dedicated to him)
                        and at the same time a great musician (Beethoven created
                        for him a large number of cadenzas that are all somewhat
                        difficult to execute). In 1809, due to Napoleon&rsquo;s
                        War of the Fifth Coalition, Vienna was lain under seige
                        in the Battle of Wagram: because of this, the royal
                        family had to leave for their safety, including the same
                        Archduke. It with the feelings that Beethoven was
                        experiencing around this time&mdash; those of loss and
                        anxiety, and eventually the joy what the Archduke
                        returned after the war&mdash; that led him to write this
                        sonata.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The piece itself is in the mold of a traditional sonata:
                        it has 3 movements, following the fast-slow-fast
                        movement form. The first movement is in E-flat major,
                        and is titled &ldquo;Das Lebewohl&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
                        Farewell&rdquo;: it has an Adagio introduction followed
                        by a healthy Allegro, much like how the Sonata
                        Pathetique had a Grave introduction followed by an
                        Allegro&mdash; so we see how Beethoven&rsquo;s usage of
                        introductions evolves throughout his oeuvre. The second
                        movement is an Andante Expressivo in C minor, and is
                        titled &ldquo;Das Abwesenheit&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
                        Absence&rdquo;: it uses a few themes repeated throughout
                        in key after key to express the cycle of emotions that
                        the persona feels while the other person is absent that
                        recur over and over again. This is then interrupted by
                        the final movement in the home key of E-flat major,
                        which is titled &ldquo;Das Wiedersehen&rdquo; or
                        &ldquo;The Return&rdquo;, and is marked Vivacissimamente
                        or &ldquo;As lively as possible&rdquo;: it is also in
                        sonata form, and it expresses the joy of seeing the
                        other person again in an almost-orchestral manner, with
                        specific passages evoking a piano concerto and thus
                        foreshadowing future &ldquo;Concertos for Solo
                        Piano&rdquo;.

                        The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was
                        published by Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an
                        urtext edition, so while I believe it is legal here in
                        the Philippines, I am not so sure about the situations
                        in other countries. The same applies for the recordings
                        which I have duly cut up into the component parts: These
                        were made by Fritz Jank in 1962. All of these resources

                    <p>
                        The sonata opens with its most important motif: the
                        &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo; motif, which Beethoven actually
                        marked with the words &ldquo;Le-be-wohl&rdquo; over the
                        notes. The motif is composed of a pair of voices
                        outlining a descending 3-2-1 motif, which starts on G
                        and ends on E-flat. Both the particular rhythm and the
                        notes will be used again and again in different contexts
                        of the sonata, so I believe it&rsquo;s well worth
                        remembering. We should also note the left hand, which
                        only enters in the third note: it plays a C, which
                        recontextualizes the notes above and changes it from an
                        E-flat major chord (which is the expected happy chord to
                        end the motif) to a C-minor chord, which gives it a
                        certain sadness and sentimentality brought by that
                        surprise change in harmony. Lastly, it is often
                        commented that this particular motif sounds like it
                        would be a horn call: horns are noted for their soft,
                        round, and gentle sound, which is something that many
                        people feel is appropriate for this particular part.
                        Jonathan Biss, a well-renowned pianist, noted that this
                        marks an evolution in Beethoven&rsquo;s capacity for
                        writing orchestral parts for piano solo: where he feels
                        that the drums and horn calls in the 3rd movement of the
                        previous funeral march sonata only impede or interrupt
                        the mournful feeling of the piece, here he notes that
                        the horn calls at the beginning add meaning and emotion
                        to the piece, which may mark a significant improvement
                        on Beethoven&rsquo;s part in writing orchestrally for
                        piano.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo; motif, we see another:
                        a rise of 3 notes, where the last 2 notes are higher
                        than the first note. This motif, which I will call the
                        &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; motif, is repeated 3 times in the
                        first line and reaches ever-higher and more wistful
                        heights. Compounded with the bass, which is falling
                        chromatically (Schiff (2004-2006) refers to this as the
                        &ldquo;Passus Duriusculus&rdquo;), and we see that this
                        next bar feels very unstable, as if we&rsquo;re
                        searching for a center or floating unmoored. This
                        downward chromatic movement, series of incomplete
                        harmonies (which, in the formal terminology, are called
                        half-cadences), and constant switching between major and
                        minor and between registers of the piano continues on
                        for another 3 bars before we reach bar 7, which has
                        another instance of the Lebewohl motif, now more
                        outlined, preparing us for a true cadence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this is diverted yet again in bar 8, where we
                        see that instead of resolving to E-flat major as we want
                        to hear or in C-minor as we heard earlier, it resolves
                        to C-flat major, a key with 7 flats and that is far away
                        from either E-flat major or C-minor. It then continues
                        on with the jumping motif in a progression very similar
                        to the one we heard earlier but now in the new key,
                        which gives it a slightly happier feeling and an
                        entirely new color that is wholly different from the one
                        we heard earlier&mdash; it feels at least slightly
                        detached from the rest, like another person talking. We
                        then have the unstable progression repeated again and
                        again, with the bass always descending chromatically,
                        which slowly darkens the mood until we reach Bar 12, and
                        then rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting in Bar 12, we now get a new progression, which
                        I think feels more like a natural extension of the
                        previous bar&rsquo;s lament as it grows more and more
                        despondent. In particular, this passage is filled to the
                        brim with rests: similarly to the Sonata Pathetique,
                        Beethoven&rsquo;s rests in particular are used to
                        heighten the drama, and here they contrast with the
                        constantly moving harmonies of the previous bars to
                        emphasize the feeling of despair that permeates this
                        passage. Other techniques can also be used to emphasize
                        the emptiness: for example, Schiff uses a staccato
                        attack to make it shorter, while Oppitz lifts the pedal
                        early to interrupt the sound. In either case, the rests
                        become more and more prevalent, until at the very end of
                        the passage there is a rest after every note and the
                        emotion reaches its height.

                    <p>
                        Directly from the gaping octaves of the end of the
                        Adagio, we get a huge statement of the octave in forte
                        which hugely contrasts with the previous section and
                        marks the beginning of the Allegro. We now get the first
                        theme of this theme group, which I will call Theme 1.1:
                        it is composed of the first four (4) bars of the
                        Allegro, in the edition bars 17-20, and it is composed
                        of two (2) figures plus the octave at the very front.
                        The first figure has this rising pattern highlighted in
                        red: I believe that it is directly taken as an extension
                        of the &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; motif at the very beginning
                        (Tovey suggests, however, that it might be accidental),
                        with the left hand being an extension of the chromatic
                        descents that also occurred and recurred over and over
                        again at the start of the piece. The second figure is
                        composed of rising legato octaves in the right hand (one
                        of the many unique challenges this piece presents to the
                        pianist) and diatonically falling thirds in the left
                        hand, which I think feels very much like a natural
                        extension of the first figure. Because of the fact that
                        these 4 bars feel more like extensions of the previous
                        segment rather than themes in their own right given that
                        they are constructed from the same materials as the
                        introduction, it can be difficult to feel like this is a
                        theme at all: however, because of the fact that it
                        recurs over and over again in the development section, I
                        think it can be safely considered as a theme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next theme in this theme group comprises another 8
                        bars, from bars 21 to 28&mdash; as per the above naming
                        system, I will refer to it as Theme 1.2. The right hand
                        is composed of octaves quickly changing register which
                        sing this very beautiful tune laden with dynamics and
                        expression. Even though, at its greatest, the right hand
                        can jump as high as 2 octaves, I think it feels more
                        like an opera singer using their full ambitus or range
                        to express themselves rather than multiple voices
                        chiming in to sing the part. I think that the right hand
                        lends most of the sentimentality of this theme, because
                        of the sheer fact that it refuses to resolve: it avoids
                        resolution after resolution and keeps on hanging on to
                        the dominant, b-flat major, which lends it more
                        sentimentality and more drive. In the left hand, we see
                        an arpeggiated accompaniment figure. Schiff notes that
                        the left hand plays an inversion of the Lebewohl motif:
                        the first lowest bass note is E-flat, then F, then G,
                        much as the Lebewohl motif is G, then F, then E-flat:
                        this particular progression is then emphasized or
                        accented by most pianists, for example by Barenboim in
                        the above video. However, Tovey notes that we need to be
                        cautious about searching and perhaps over-highlighting
                        all of the instances of the Lebewohl motif: he argues
                        that it was intentionally added not necessarily for the
                        listener to pay attention to it but rather for the
                        subconscious to detect it and then associate it with the
                        sad emotions of the beginning, to be an undercurrent of
                        sadness to the excitability of the right hand. I believe
                        that we should still emphasize the lower notes, but
                        nevertheless take Tovey&rsquo;s note into consideration,
                        as his explanation lends credence to why this part still
                        feels very sentimental even though we&rsquo;re now going
                        at a full allegro.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The transition comprises a full 21 bars: this is by far
                        an absolutely gigantic transition, especially when
                        compared to the first theme group which is only around
                        half as long. This is in stark comparison to the Sonata
                        Pathetique, where the first theme group and the
                        transition are of about equal length, or the Funeral
                        March Sonata, where the transition is around the same
                        length as the B part. I think this is primarily due to
                        the sheer economy of the first theme group: because so
                        many of the ideas have already been exposed, the first
                        group can be significantly shorter than usual, which
                        means the transition feels oddly out of proportion.
                        Tovey also notes that &ldquo;one of the best ways of
                        getting an effect of breadth in a short time is by
                        devoting ample space to dominant preparation&rdquo;
                        (Tovey, p.190-191): in this case, the harmonies mostly
                        emphasize the dominant of the dominant, F, in order to
                        prepare the second theme group which is in the dominant
                        key. Lastly, the fact that it stays so long without
                        resolving properly into the dominant combined with its
                        fast speed gives it a breathless feeling, as if someone
                        is trying to catch up to the person who is leaving to
                        say goodbye or something like that. This is emphasized
                        by the writing of the next theme group, when we have 2
                        voices interlocking. As for its structure, the Lebewohl
                        motif permeates this entire passage, this time in
                        diminution or in small note values: this transition can
                        prove difficult due to the rather fast scales in thirds
                        and in chords that can trip up the player.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Theme Group 2</h3>

                        <img

                    <p>
                        After that, we have the first theme of the second theme
                        group, Theme 2.1, in the expected key of B-flat major.
                        The uppermost voice of the right hand very clearly has
                        the Lebewohl motif, this time with an extra tail that
                        allows the voice to wander for the duration of the
                        third, longest, note. Beneath this, we have an extension
                        of the eighth-note figures that we saw earlier in the
                        lower right hand, which adds a little bit of difficulty:
                        lastly, in the left hand, we have a syncopated chord
                        progression (which may be based on the jumping motif of
                        the introduction, but that&rsquo;s probably accidental)
                        that, when placed in contrast with the rather placid
                        right hand, gives it a little bit of a jaunty character.
                        After the statement of the Lebewohl in the double-high
                        register 2 octaves above middle C, we get a repeat of
                        the same statement in the high register 1 octave above
                        middle C: I believe that this part feels like 2 voices
                        repeating the same thing, and in particular the
                        interpretation above makes it feel like 4 voices, with
                        the top right and and the left hand contrasting each
                        other. Together, the rich harmonization that constantly
                        surrounds this part and its unique lyricism that stands
                        out from the motivism of the previous sections makes it
                        one of the most meaningful parts of the Sonata every
                        time it reemerges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this, the three voices compress onto one staff,
                        making these next few bars somewhat tricky to interpret.
                        The interpreter above, Barenboim, emphasizes the lowest
                        voice as it descends while he changes the upper voice to
                        be playing accompaniment to give the illusion that the
                        eighth-note figures from the previous theme are
                        continuing, as does Schiff: Oppitz and Lortie, however,
                        either allow the the bass voice and the top voice
                        equality or alternate between emphasizing the bass voice
                        and the top voice. In either case, the decision is for
                        the interpreter to make. After those 4 bars, the music
                        simplifies to two voices that begin repeating and
                        passing off to each other (or &ldquo;imitating&rdquo;)
                        the Lebewohl motif, first in diminution (again, in short
                        note values) and then simplified to 2 notes, the second
                        being longer than the first. After that, the music slows
                        and softens to an almost complete halt, when we get the
                        full Lebewohl motif in whole notes in the left hand but
                        is then interrupted by the right hand after 2 bars to
                        either prepare us for the return to the exposition or to
                        move the harmony onward to the dominant.

                    <p>
                        In the middle and late periods of Beethoven&rsquo;s
                        life, we begin to see more and more compression: the
                        development is no exception to this general trend, with
                        a significant number of harmonic and melodic changes all
                        occurring, sometimes even with implied harmonies. While
                        it can be divided any number of ways, I have elected to
                        divide it into 2 parts, as per the work of Kumar (2017).

                        The development starts with the connecting passage
                        leading straight into a statement of only the head of
                        Theme 1.1 in the key of C-minor. Right after this,
                        however, we get a rather mysterious part which makes us
                        feel unsteady or unmoored: statements of the (altered)
                        Lebewohl motif, alone and unharmonized, alternate with
                        huge chords and constantly-shifting statements of the
                        jumping motif in the left hand. Another interpretation
                        has it that the chord is actually the third, long, note
                        of the Lebewohl motif with extra harmonization, albeit
                        noticing this requires a certain balance to the chords
                        that I have not yet heard. The fact that there is so
                        much empty space in this theme compounded with the
                        chromaticity of the chords makes this part feel very
                        alone&mdash; it echoes the second movement&rsquo;s
                        constant use of the jumping theme to express loneliness.
                        Interestingly, Tovey is able to make sense of the
                        progression by extracting every chord and then
                        demonstrating how the Lebewohl motif is both a natural
                        extension of the chords and bridges gaps between the
                        chords (p.192), albeit parsing it requires an advanced
                        understanding of harmonic language that I do not have.
                        In any event, it then reaches the dominant key of
                        B-flat, where it repeats itself to mark its importance
                        (and maybe heralding the beginning of the
                        recapitulation) before slipping up chromatically and
                        having Theme 1.1 enter in A-flat then fall into G-flat
                        major before diverting into the second half of the
                        development.

                        In my opinion, these 16 bars of development are all
                        there to lead back to the recapitulation: much as the
                        transition between Theme 1.2 and Theme 2.1 was
                        extraordinarily long, so is this transition between the
                        Development and the Recapitulation. At this point,
                        everything becomes very slow and placid, almost
                        despairing and lifelorn: everything is set in piano
                        softening to pianissimo, and the right hand chords seem
                        to be falling under their own weight. In the left hand,
                        we just have the jumping motif constantly playing, like
                        an ostinato, no longer adding to the bounciness of the
                        theme but rather sputtering out and dying. The first
                        four bars of this section have both the right hand and
                        the left hand falling together: this first part uses
                        enharmonic shifting to modulate from the G-flat major of
                        the previous statement of Theme 1.1 into C minor, with
                        Tovey highlighting the 2nd bar (Bar 95) in particular as
                        being the one to shift from one key to the other. After
                        those four (4) bars, the left hand settles of the note C
                        instead of falling any further: however, the right hand
                        just continues falling and falling. This goes on for
                        another 6 bars before the left hand is simplified, the
                        aforementioned &ldquo;sputtering out&rdquo;: it now just
                        becomes a single broken octave, repeated twice. Before
                        long, we settle on a single chord: C, E-flat, and
                        A-flat, which, after 3 bars of tension, expands to the
                        right hand, builds up in a technique called
                        &ldquo;stretto&rdquo;, and leads us directly back to the
                        recapitulation.

                        I don&rsquo;t think the recapitulation is of too much
                        interest, given that it is an almost exact reproduction
                        of the exposition. There are only a few differences
                        between this section and the exposition. The least
                        important changes happen to the transition and the
                        second theme group: the most obvious one is that the
                        passage is transposed to the tonic of E-flat major, but
                        it may also include moving the passage 1 octave up,
                        adding an extra note to fill out the octave, or removing
                        an extra bar to modulate correctly. However, what I
                        think is the most important change for the pianist to
                        note happens in bar 118: here, the left-hand voicing is
                        very slightly altered to have the &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo;
                        motif occur in half notes and then stall for extra-long
                        on the third note rather than in whole notes. According
                        to Tovey, this change is intentional: the autograph
                        shows that he wrote out this altered figure after
                        crossing out the original version, the direct copy of
                        Bar 25. Furthermore, this very slight, perhaps only
                        subconscious change comes to fruition in the Coda, where
                        a very similar passage in the left hand occurs close to
                        the climax of dramatic action&mdash; thus, in my
                        purview, it is not a good idea to correct it (for
                        example, as Hans Bulow does in his &ldquo;Instructive
                        Edition&rdquo;).

                    <p>
                        One of the characteristics that makes the Les Adieux
                        sonata so unique is that its coda is so long: where the
                        exposition only comprises one and a half pages, and the
                        development comprises only 1 page, the coda comprises
                        two and a half pages: The fact that the Coda is both so
                        long and has so much thematic development (rather than
                        just restatements of the theme, as in the first movement
                        of the Sonata Pathetique or in the last movement of the
                        Moonlight Sonata) sets it apart from the other sonatas
                        of its day. Jonathan Biss notes that this emphasis on
                        both the Coda and the Introduction was such a large
                        innovation that it began to bend the rules of what can
                        compose a sonata: he notes that this is only one in a
                        long line of compromises, ranging from focusing more on
                        the intervals of the third and the sixth rather than the
                        fifth as in his late sonatas, to not having any movement
                        in sonata form like the Funeral March Sonata, to having
                        protracted and thematic intros and codas like this
                        sonata, to removing the development altogether as per
                        the 2nd movement of the Tempest Sonata. In this case, I
                        think it&rsquo;s better to think of the coda like an
                        altered 2nd repeat of the recapitulation and then the
                        actual Coda, which is somewhere at the end. Thus, we can
                        divide it into 3: first theme group, second theme group,
                        and ending.

                        The coda begins with 4 bars of transition: these mirror
                        the last 4 bars of the Exposition, which lead either to
                        its own repeat or into the Development. Of course, it
                        can be argued whether this is actually part of the Coda
                        or part of the previous Recapitulation: the sources I
                        have read, however, mostly agree that this transition is
                        part of the Coda. This passage modulates us to the
                        interesting key of F-minor, on the second scale degree
                        of E-flat major.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then have both Theme 1.1 and Theme 1.2 in the key of
                        F-minor. This is one of the most important moments in
                        the whole sonata for both themes. The first theme
                        changes so that there are no more held notes: combined
                        with the fact that this occurrence is in a minor key
                        rather than in the major keys of previous occurrences, I
                        think this passage feels very desperate and yearning.
                        The tail of the theme in particular is interesting: the
                        changed contour of the notes due to the sudden
                        inflection downward at the end really deepens and
                        strengthens the emotions present in the music. However,
                        I feel like the greatest transformation happens not to
                        Theme 1.1 but rather to Theme 1.2&mdash; This particular
                        instance of the theme, in my opinion, is the climax of
                        the entire work: the desperation and yearning that has
                        been roiling and building up is let go in this very
                        moment, and the anguish and true wish to keep the other
                        person from departing presents itself in its strongest
                        form. Barenboim, in particular, has a very effective
                        interpretation where he adds an extra pause after the 4
                        jumping octaves to contrast the jumping octaves with the
                        tail of Theme 1.2. After this occurrence of Theme 1.2 in
                        F minor, Beethoven prolongs the moment, in a sense, by
                        providing half of a repetition in the key of E-flat
                        minor: however, this repetition is interrupted by a
                        modulation in what is supposed to be the second half of
                        the theme. (This is where the previously mentioned
                        &ldquo;odd movement&rdquo; of the left hand recurs yet
                        again, this time being used to modulate.) At this point,
                        we can say that the theme &ldquo;explodes&rdquo;: having
                        reached its dramatic height, it disappears just as
                        dramatically, in this case never to be seen again. Thus,
                        all that remains is the Lebewohl motif and its dying
                        out.

                        We begin with a transition from that
                        &ldquo;cliffhanger&rdquo;, in a sense: yet again, we see
                        that Beethoven uses the Lebewohl motif to bring us to
                        the right key, this time without interruptions from
                        chords but instead bringing us there via dialogue
                        between the left hand and the right hand. It is this way
                        that he is able to bring us back home to the tonic key
                        for Theme 2.1. He prepares us for the entrance by using
                        a false cadence in bar 195 on the mediant or on G, which
                        is the exact same note that Theme 2.1 starts with.

                        When Theme 2.1 occurs (some 16 bars later, it should be
                        noted), it is also changed: gone now are the jumping
                        chords of the right hand and the trill-like
                        accompaniment of the alto voice, and all that remains is
                        the melody itself and a counterpoint in eight-notes.
                        Especially in comparison to the rich accompaniment and
                        full tone of the previous recurrences of Theme 2.1, this
                        one feels more simple and sweet. After the first half of
                        the theme, the Lebewohl motif moves into the left hand
                        and the counterpoint into the right&mdash; the left hand
                        is only able to go on for 2 measures, however, before
                        repeating those 2 bars again in the middle octave and
                        again in the high octave before falling down for another
                        2 bars. The two hands then repeat this dance, with only
                        slight variations: the 4-bar theme perfectly in the
                        right hand, then the same theme cut up again in the left
                        hand and rising for 6 bars. However, instead of falling
                        in 2 bars, it takes 4 bars to fall back down, this time
                        reusing the short-long-short pattern of the left hand
                        all the way back in the first occurrence of Theme 2.1
                        and softening to an almost complete halt.

                        The first part of this coda recalls the transition from
                        the First Theme Group to the Second Theme Group: it also
                        has the Lebewohl motif deconstructed, albeit this time
                        always in the key of E-flat major. This deconstruction
                        goes on for 12 bars, and the meaning behind it is
                        well-hidden, if it exists at all. Both Perahia (2019),
                        in the introduction to his edition of the sonatas, and
                        Agmon (1996) suspect that this part may be more
                        psychological compared to anything else: the ultimate
                        goal of these 12 bars is to get the left hand to state
                        the Lebewohl motif both completely and both in the right
                        key and register by repeating the Lebewohl motif over
                        and over again for the first 8 bars then rising higher
                        and higher (and diminishing the note-value of the first
                        note from whole to quarter) for the next 4 bars. Once
                        this &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; is complete in bar 234, the
                        rest of the 21 bars are there to tone-paint: for
                        example, the 4 bars directly afterward are the
                        descending horn calls that mark the person&rsquo;s
                        departure and the 4 bars after that are like the sound
                        of horses&rsquo; feet (and form the most compressed that
                        we have seen the Lebewohl theme, now reduced to 2
                        quarter notes). After that, we see the left hand and
                        right hand at their furthest apart, with the left hand
                        playing a falling bass that reminds us of the Lebewohl
                        motif, and the right hand playing extremely high scales
                        in counterpoint: while previous points may have been the
                        climax of drama, this is a significant climax of
                        sentimentality, and I personally believe that this part,
                        when rendered well, can always give goosebumps. (Agmon
                        notes that at this point, we have an exact reversal of
                        the introduction, with a C-octave in the right hand and
                        the E-flat and G in the left, but instead of propelling
                        the piece this fizzles out to a harmless B-octave.
                        Schiff also notes that on the C-octave, a crescendo is
                        written, making it impossible for the pianist. Lastly,
                        Perahia notes that this is also tone-painting, if we
                        think of it like the carriage of the archduke going on a
                        hill or faraway mountain then disappearing.) The piece
                        then ends on two forte staccato chords, perhaps
                        indicating that the persona is trying to resist falling
                        away into sentimentality and is resolved to stay happy
                        even if the other person is leaving.

                    <h2 id="conc">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        This piece is, in my opinion, one of the masterworks of
                        sonata form. It is considered in the pantheon of the
                        great works of Beethoven&rsquo;s middle period: it ranks
                        equal to the Waldstein Sonata and the Appassionata
                        Sonata in this regard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also the last idiomatically middle-period sonata
                        of Beethoven. It was 5 years before he published another
                        sonata, in 1815: this work is significantly different
                        from his other works but it is unclear whether it
                        belongs to the middle period or the late period, with
                        Rosen, for example, placing it in neither. Indeed, this
                        first movement may have just been saying farewell for a
                        coming return: but somehow, it also marked farewell to
                        the conventions of Sonata Form as we know it, and
                        further forward we will now be seeing fugues, themes and
                        variations, and sonatas with unclear themes and
                        transitions. Beethoven&rsquo;s music here becomes so
                        different and so unique that even today, we have about
                        as much difficulty parsing it as the people of
                        Beethoven&rsquo;s day did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But still, this sonata is open to read. And indeed, its
                        use of tone-painting, however reluctant in some cases,
                        foretells the use of tone-painting by other composers:
                        it most clearly leads directly to the tone-painting of
                        Schumann and Grieg. And the sonata&rsquo;s virtuosity
                        still makes it a favorite for travelling pianists, which
                        no doubt further adds to its popularity. Thank you for
                        reading!
