                    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        This sonata was the last sonata Beethoven ever wrote:
                        Op. 111, written some 10 years after the Les Adieux
                        sonata in 1821. It was written as part of a trio with
                        Op. 109 and Op. 110: however, unlike the trios of his
                        youth, they are assigned different opus numbers and they
                        were sold separately to set each of them as equal in
                        importance to all of the others. All three works are
                        solidly in the style of his late period, and each
                        expresses a different concept or idea. All three works
                        are also a huge break from the sonatas of the past, and
                        all look forward to the future of music, this one being
                        no exception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The form of the sonata is still somewhat traditional, in
                        a sense: it begins with a fast first movement in Sonata
                        Form, and a slow second movement in Theme and Variations
                        form. The second movement is particularly well-known
                        because it seems to foretell the syncopated rhythms of
                        boogie-woogie (albeit this is and has always been put
                        under heavy scrutiny, given that there is little way by
                        which Beethoven would have informed the African-American
                        roots of that genre) and because its final variation is
                        particularly enigmatic, not least because the theme is
                        never completed in its final statement. The first
                        movement is also also interesting in its own right, not
                        least because the color of this movement is far darker
                        than any movement Beethoven has written before: like a
                        great castle of obsidian, it looms in the dark,
                        edg&eacute;d and broken, haunting all. Due to that, at
                        the very least, I think it is worth analyzing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was
                        published by Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an
                        urtext edition, so while I believe it is legal here in
                        the Philippines, I am not so sure about the situations
                        in other countries. The same applies for the recordings
                        which I have duly cut up into the component parts: These
                        were made by Fritz Jank in 1962. All of these resources
                        can be found in the

                    <p>
                        The sonata begins with this huge, declamatory statement:
                        two octaves crashing down on each other, then two huge
                        chords in the right hand. Together, they outline an
                        F-sharp diminished seventh chord: this chord is very
                        notable because every note in it is a tritone away from
                        another note in the same chord. It is also notable for
                        making an appearance in the Sonata Pathetique, as the
                        first chord of the third bar&mdash; indeed, we can say
                        that this sonata is very similar to the Sonata
                        Pathetique in terms of color (both are dark, albeit this
                        is really pitch-black) and somewhat in terms of form. In
                        any case, we continue onwards with this rather stark
                        trill (probably because the accompaniment has moved up
                        to the middle register, so we don&rsquo;t sense it as
                        much as the very low bass notes of the previous bar) and
                        then 3 large chords and a great arpeggiated flourish
                        that finish on G-major, which is the dominant of
                        C-minor. (It should be noted that there is a C-minor
                        chord, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a resolution at
                        all, probably because it falls on a downbeat.) This
                        statement is then repeated on the B diminished seventh
                        chord moving to C major as the dominant of F-minor, then
                        begins again on what is supposed to be E diminished
                        seventh. It should be noted that, once all of these
                        chords are combined, they form the 12 tones of the
                        chromatic scale, which Schiff notes may be an omen of
                        12-tone music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, on the last occurrence, instead of completing
                        the Edim7 chord, the bass and treble move upward to form
                        a B-flat minor chord, which dashes the cycle and allows
                        us to move forward. Here, the right hand begins to
                        descend diatonically and the left hand begins to ascend
                        chromatically through various keys using the first
                        rhythm: this transitory part is usually played more
                        gently compared to the gigantic chords of the first few
                        bars, as per its piano dynamic. This descending phrase
                        lasts 5 bars, which complement the first 5 bars of
                        introduction proper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next 8 bars are considered as dominant preparation,
                        primarily due to the dominant pedal in the alto voice
                        and also because all of the upper progressions end in
                        the dominant major. Again, the progression lasts only 2
                        bars, and then repeats itself one octave lower. The last
                        4 bars are used to transition from the Maestoso
                        introduction to the Allegro con Brio ed Appassionato by
                        repeating the dominant chord in the right hand and then
                        using a measured-out trill in the extreme bass that
                        should have the same note-value from one tempo to the
                        other. (It should be noted that this is one of the most
                        interesting ways of saying that the Maestoso should be
                        half the speed of the Allegro before the notation for
                        Metric Modulation was invented.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, even though this introduction is highly
                        reminiscent of the introduction to the Sonata
                        Pathetique, this introduction is different in one major
                        way from the previous introductions: all of the thematic
                        material that is used here is never seen again. The two
                        themes of the introduction are almost independent of
                        this introduction, with the only possible link being the
                        second theme to the transition passage that Tovey
                        dismisses as bunkum. Instead, it is the harmony of the
                        introduction (and the dotted rhythm, but that&rsquo;s
                        probably accidental), with its very unique progression
                        of diminished seventh chords, that is reused later on in
                        the development.

                    <p>
                        Note: Especially with Beethoven&rsquo;s late themes, it
                        becomes much more fruitful to think about it as a
                        collection of motifs rather than a singular theme (or
                        maybe a theme with a head and tail). This is because
                        Beethoven plays around with different instances of these
                        motifs, and combines them in interesting ways and
                        extends them freely in order to generate the material of
                        the piece. This is most apparent in the Hammerklavier
                        sonata, where the 3rd part of the theme is extended for
                        the better part of 6 bars before the second entrance in
                        the fugue. But this sort of free extension happens with
                        essentially all of the late sonatas that bother to be in
                        sonata form. Thus, while there is only 1 theme in Theme
                        Group 1, I will be dividing it up into motifs using
                        letters: e.g. Motif 1a, 2b.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any case, we begin with a very quick rise of four (or
                        three, it depends if you&rsquo;re OK with motifs
                        overlapping) notes that go straight up from G to C: this
                        is called the Schleifer by Tovey, and I will call it
                        Motif 1a. This is mentioned in unison by both the left
                        and and the right hand, forming a very powerful octave
                        that adds to the starkness of the theme. After that, we
                        have the rise yet again but now with an extension, the
                        C-Eb-B motif that also comprises Theme 1 and that will
                        be called Motif 1b (and which overlaps with Motif 1a,
                        but the boundaries of motifs are very unclear and I just
                        hear it that way). After a fermata on the dissonant
                        B-natural, we get an entrance of the full Theme 1 in Bar
                        21 with motifs 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d, with each motif
                        overlapping with another, as can be seen in the
                        following illustration:
                    </p>

                        <figcaption>
                            Note: the exact positioning of motif 1b and 1c
                            really depends on how the interpreter phrases it: it
                            they detach the sf note from the rest, then 1b has
                            only 3 notes, but if they slur it to the next note,
                            then 1b has 4, overlapping with 1c. Same goes with
                            the interface of 1a and 1b, and 1c to 1d.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Directly after that, just as we repeated 1a and 1b, we
                        now repeat 1c and 1d with a little bit of hesitation and
                        then extend the tail of the theme, 1c and 1d combined,
                        but expressed in the rhythm of 1d for 5 bars. The
                        easiest way to notice this is to pay careful attention
                        to the accented notes of certain interpreters like
                        Korstick, which will make the theme obvious: with other
                        interpretations, you just have to pay special attention
                        to the general contour of the theme and compare it to
                        the memory of motifs 1c and 1d.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that passage, we now state Theme 1 in its full
                        form, with the first 3 motifs being harmonized by
                        quarter notes in the alto right hand and by a
                        counterpoint in the left hand and the last motif left
                        alone. Similar to the previous statement of Theme 1, the
                        tail of 1c and 1d are repeated again with hesitation,
                        <i>poco ritenente</i> or slightly slowed down, with a
                        slightly more extended harmony and a dominant
                        pedal-point in both the left and and the right hand,
                        before performing another free and virtuosic extension,
                        this time on Motif 1c. (We should note that this is
                        where we have the first instance of an octave
                        counterpoint in the left hand: while most interpreters
                        usually keep this to the role of accompaniment, this
                        type of accompaniment-figure will become very important
                        as we enter the transition.) Lastly, the music slows
                        down a lot (to become quarter notes rather than the very
                        fast 16th notes of the previous bar) and we get a
                        cadence, a full close, by using an augmented (or
                        slowed-down) form of motif 1d ornamented with a trill.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, the close is suddenly broken by a <i>forte</i>
                        , which means to play loud (in this case, suddenly): the
                        left hands goes off into an 16th note extension of Motif
                        1d, while the right hand plays Motif 1b then a form of
                        Motif 1c in augmentation but using the rhythm of Motif
                        1d. Here, it becomes really obvious that what looks on
                        the surface to just be a free extension of 1d is
                        actually 1c or 1c + 1d (it depends on interpretation)
                        expressed in the rhythm of 1d, if you listen carefully
                        to the sections that are delineated by the arpeggios.
                        While the right hand plays this very fast figuration,
                        the left hand plays an extension of 1c + 1d in full
                        octaves, with 1d expressed in the rhythm of 1c. Thus,
                        the two hands mirror each other, and at the same time
                        play a counterpoint to each other. After this first
                        statement, the left hand begins playing 1b in octaves,
                        then passes that off to the right hand to play 1c + 1d
                        (octave) thrice as the left hand takes the 1c + 1d
                        (running notes) figuration. Again, in an even higher
                        register, the right hand states 1b (in single notes),
                        then passes off the 1c + 1d octaves to the left hand as
                        it takes the 1c + 1d running notes. This very fast
                        passage is considered a transition because it modulates
                        a lot: from the beginning in C-minor, the first
                        occurrence takes us up 2 steps to E-flat major, and the
                        second occurrence takes us up 3 steps to A-flat major,
                        and the third occurrence takes us all the way up 3 steps
                        again to D-flat, which is really far away from C.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this very distant place, Beethoven is able to take
                        us back by using a very dramatic figure: he has the left
                        hand go all the way back to the bass, play tremolo
                        chords, then have the right hand crash all the way down
                        from the very top of the keyboard to the bass then back
                        up to resolve to E-flat, the dominant of A-flat major.
                        This feels a lot like the explosion at the end of the
                        Les Adieux sonata: after this, the music gets winded,
                        and thus has to take a rest, and this rest forms the
                        second theme group.

                    <p>
                        The second theme group, lasting only 2 bars, stands in
                        stark contrast to the first, most of all because it is
                        not stark: it is warm, which heavily contrasts with the
                        dire and angered nature of the first theme and the
                        transition and the glorious or humorous nature of the
                        material after this theme. Schiff notes that it feels
                        like an island in the roiling sea&mdash; I would add
                        that it also feels like the eye of a hurricane, in a
                        sense, albeit that metaphor falls apart once we see the
                        second half of the exposition. According to Kumar, it
                        also feels improvised: this is made clear by the second
                        repetition of the second theme, where every other note
                        has an ornament and where the tempo is altered very
                        freely. Lastly, it is singular: it cannot be segmented
                        into multiple meaningful motifs, as it is composed of
                        just the syncopated rhythm repeated in different
                        registers and harmonies. Thus, it heavily contrasts with
                        everything that came before it. It reminds me heavily of
                        the recitatives in the Tempest sonata: and much like
                        those recitatives, this one is interrupted before it has
                        the chance to stay long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is interrupted by a fortissimo falling
                        arpeggio-flourish, outlining a D diminished seventh
                        chord, which is exactly equal to an A-flat diminished
                        seventh, spanning 3 full octaves. After a short scale,
                        we now get an instance of Motif 1b three times with a
                        new jumping-up figure that Tovey calls figure (e), and
                        that I will call Motif 2e to represent the fact that it
                        was introduced separately from the rest. This particular
                        combination of motifs is very interesting: because it is
                        a whole 4 bars long, it can equally be called a theme,
                        and it can play over and over again because it resolves
                        into itself. In any case, this odd combination of 1b +
                        2e moves over to the top voice of the right hand with
                        alto voices and bass voices appearing that mimic the
                        restatement of 1a + 1b + 1c in the domain of the first
                        theme group. This part is unusual because it is solidly
                        in the major key, but its unusually hollow structure
                        gives us the sense that it could turn sour, go to the
                        minor key, at any time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, we reach the cadence. The motif 2e is
                        transformed into a new scalar figure, with a trill being
                        placed on the long note. This theme, regrettably, is
                        associated with childhood and play where I come from,
                        and thus it loses the grandeur of the previous
                        statements of 1b [*3] + 2e in favor of a rather funny
                        cadence. Even worse, the left hand descends so low that
                        the tones are barely recognizable, making it feel more
                        like a rumbling bass rather than a properly functioning
                        accompaniment. This is probably not the effect that
                        Beethoven intended&mdash; indeed, one can argue that
                        this is a by-product of a rather malign process called
                        reification, as per Keary (2019)&mdash; but it
                        nevertheless stands in contrast to the rest of the
                        sonata and emphasizes the nature of the disparate parts
                        united together by their contrast. Finally, after a long
                        cadenza-like flourish running upwards, we resolve on
                        A-flat, then use motif 1a to go all the way back to the
                        beginning.

                        The development of this sonata is actually rather
                        compressed: much as the sonatas of the classical form,
                        this is only a small fraction of the size of the
                        exposition. However, a lot happens in those few short
                        moments. It can technically be divided into 3 parts,
                        which will not be delineated by section headers given
                        that they are fairly short.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we get one of the shortest modulations in
                        probably the history of music: directly after the octave
                        A that ends the exposition, we have a single octave G
                        played piano, and then a forte D-major chord in its
                        first inversion. Rosen notes that this is one of the
                        most laconic and efficient modulations, given that it
                        occurs in 2 notes: he says that they are &ldquo;all that
                        is necessary&rdquo; (p. 244) to move us to G minor. In
                        any case, a form of the first theme composed of 1a + 1b
                        [*2] + 2e (the upward rush, then the dun-dun-dun, then
                        the jumping up motif) is played in bare octaves (but
                        still an octave apart, giving the illusion that the
                        pianist is somehow playing 5 octaves) and in piano.
                        However, at the point motif 2e is supposed to end in G,
                        the first voice of what seems to be a new theme enters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This new theme, in fact, takes 2 inspirations: it has
                        the overall contour of a slowed-down or augmented motif
                        1b, and Rosen states that the intervals of the new theme
                        are related to the dominant sevenths of the
                        introduction. It is different from those most notably
                        because it has a trill on the F-sharp, which directly
                        leads to G: this will be the hint for anyone who
                        attempts to parse the coming fugue that they are
                        listening to the theme. For convenience, I will call
                        this the Development theme, given that, much like the
                        introductory material, it doesn&rsquo;t occur anywhere
                        else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, we begin to have a double fugue on the development
                        theme and on Theme 1, composed of motifs 1b + 1c (and
                        sometimes) + 1d. This means that we will hear the two
                        themes interlocking with each other and both being
                        developed equally. The usual way that we listen to a
                        fugue is we search for the theme or themes being stated
                        in multiple voices, and try to see when it emergen and
                        in what key it emerges. Fugal texture is when we hear
                        consecutive mentions of the theme in different
                        registers, or we hear overlapping mentions of the theme
                        in different registers (this doesn&#39;t happen in this
                        case, but it happens in other cases). In this case, we
                        see that in bar 76, the theme enters in the alto voice
                        in the key of G minor: in bar 78, the bass voice in C
                        minor; and in bar 80, in the soprano voice in F minor.
                        Similarly, in bar 76.5, motifs 1b + 1c appear in the
                        bass voice in G minor; in bar 78.5, in the soprano voice
                        in C minor; and in bar 80.5, in the alto voice in F
                        minor.
                        <!-- These entrances are illustrated in the following diagram: -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right afterwards, the fugue breaks apart: we hear the
                        motifs in reverse order (1d + 1c) turned into fast but
                        non-virtuosic 16th notes in the right hand, and we hear
                        the trill that delineated the ending of the development
                        theme in the left hand. After another repetition down 1
                        octave, the left hand begins to descend chromatically
                        and the right hand&rsquo;s sixteenth notes roil over (in
                        a move that reminds me somewhat of Bar 32, but
                        that&rsquo;s rather baseless speculation and should be
                        confirmed by a professional before being considered as
                        fact) into a great tremolo that moves on the the next
                        part.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This next part begins one bar before the double barline:
                        the double barline states the change in key, not the
                        change in part as with other uses of the double barline.
                        We now have a fully-harmonized statement of Motif 1b
                        rising up and up for five bars: combined with the
                        tumultuous arpeggios in the left hand that rise in 16th
                        notes with intervals as large as an octave and a third
                        (amateurs beware), and this part can be very tricky for
                        the performer and very dramatic for the listener.
                        Nevertheless, there is still a method to the madness, so
                        to speak: the lowest note of the left hand is always a
                        G, whether it be the lowest G or the G that is still on
                        the bass clef, something which Tovey states is a
                        full-fledged &ldquo;home dominant pedal&rdquo; (p. 275).
                        The final chords in the right hand also form the same
                        progression as in the introduction: F-sharp diminished
                        seventh in Bar 86, B diminished seventh in Bar 87, and E
                        diminished seventh in Bar 88, and then again one octave
                        up: F-sharp diminished seventh in Bar 89, and B
                        diminished seventh in Bar 90.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, that occurrence in Bar 90 is very special. If
                        we look at the original statement of Motif 1b, it goes
                        C-Eb-B: and here, yet again, we have C-Eb-B in the
                        topmost voice. Given that we have now reached the
                        &ldquo;correct&rdquo; statement of Motif 1b, the E
                        diminished seventh chord is not stated again and instead
                        the music uses the 1c + 1d (stated in the 16th note
                        pattern of 1d) to go all the way back to the
                        recapitulation.

                    <p>
                        The recapitulation is very long, and much of it concerns
                        already-exposed material. [Also, I&rsquo;m running out
                        of time to write.] Thus, instead of walking you through
                        the minutiae of this section, I&rsquo;ll just cover the
                        changes that have been made to each of the theme groups
                        and to the transition.

                        Unlike its counterpart some 4 pages ago, there is no
                        repetition of Theme Group 1 in open octaves and then
                        harmonized. Instead, in the sole occurrence of the full
                        theme, the first statement of 1b + 1c + 1d lies in full
                        octaves (with a middle note implied, so 5 voices) and
                        the next 2 repetitions of 1b + 1c + 1d are both
                        harmonized. What was once bar 32 has been altered, so
                        instead of playing a tremolo pedal point in one hand the
                        pedal is moved to the octave left and the right hand
                        plays the octave extension of 1c + 1d. Those bars also
                        contain a somewhat secretive modulation to the fourth
                        scale degree of F minor: it is from this key that the
                        new transition will begin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This transition is very similar to the previous one,
                        except it now begins on F minor: thus, the first entry
                        occurs in F minor and 1c occurs thrice (AKA a rise of 3
                        notes); the second entry occurs in B-flat minor and 1c
                        occurs twice (a rise of 2 notes); the third entry occurs
                        in D-flat major. However, after the third entry, the
                        counterpoint composed of the 1c + 1d octaves completely
                        disappears: thus, the two voices return to homophony by
                        both stating 1c + 1d running notes. (Note to the
                        score-reader: the way I determined the key of the
                        current run for this next part is to look at the first
                        16th note of the 4th grouping in the right hand.) Then,
                        after rising through D natural, then E natural, then
                        F-sharp, then G (this is the left-hand note), then C, we
                        now reach the dramatic 2 bars. This is also changed: the
                        left hand now does some almost-unnoticed harmonic
                        progression, moving chromatically upwards, first from
                        E-flat up to E natural then from F to F-sharp, until we
                        reach the G.

                    <p>
                        The second theme group has a lot more alteration
                        compared to the first theme group, albeit most of it is
                        to the transitions between the main parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we have Theme 2 transposed directly to the tonic:
                        this takes up the first 8 bars. However, instead of a
                        compression like what we saw in the First Theme Group,
                        we see an expansion, something like a second development
                        of sorts, one that is very helpfully delineated between
                        the 2 instances of the words &ldquo;Tempo I&rdquo;. The
                        first 2 bars of this interpolation feel much more like a
                        chordal extension of the harmony of Theme 2 proper,
                        which allow its improvisational quality to continue on
                        for a little bit longer: however, in reality, it is very
                        well-measured, given that the bass falls from C minor to
                        F minor, the subdominant, which appears many times
                        throughout this work. The next 4 bars also extend
                        somewhat naturally from the previous 2: for the first
                        half, the bass states the melody with the right hand
                        playing a rather sparse arpeggio figuration, then the
                        right hand states the ornament and then continues on
                        with the theme. However, at this point, Beethoven does
                        something very interesting: instead of moving straight
                        to the huge descending arpeggio cadenza of Bar 55, he
                        takes a 4-bar diversion by using the right hand of the
                        last bar to rise upward and upward, increasing the
                        dynamic and the speed along the way. This causes a great
                        feeling of unease, as what was once a rather innocent
                        little figure grows to become a menace in its own right:
                        this then climaxes at the falling arpeggio figure, which
                        has been lengthened for another bar to allow us to get
                        back to the home key of C minor from the rather distant
                        space that had been reached.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even this next part, which would fall under the scope of
                        a false Theme 2.2, has changed (much as the second
                        themes change in the Sonata Pathetique): no longer is it
                        glorious, good-natured, or even funny as in the previous
                        trills, but now rather dire and anxious, marching
                        ever-onwards. The harmonies no longer suggest a calm
                        sunset that would be rather touching and meaningful if
                        it weren&#39;t for the stinted accompaniment: instead,
                        both the accompaniment and the harmony now lend to the
                        dour coloration of the music. The music here is really
                        suggestive of a full orchestra, with full octavic
                        treatment and constant register-switching: the accented
                        bass cannot be loud enough to play, especially given
                        that Beethoven marks it a full fortissimo, as loud as
                        possible. This lasts all the way until the end of the
                        Second Theme Group, with a long chromatic scale ending
                        on the correct note of C.

                        The coda begins with these stark chords, all played
                        fortissimo and sforzando. But then, the resolve of the
                        music seems to weaken, and it gets tired after an
                        admittedly very long series of outbursts: the chords
                        begin to <i>diminuendo</i> and soften in attack. Soon,
                        it reaches the piano dynamic, and a very picturesque
                        scene is conjured (which is unusual, because the rest of
                        this music has been non-programmatic, so it is odd that
                        it ends in such a picturesque way): a bass ostinato
                        rumbles on beneath, like ocean-waves diminished and
                        corralled in an underground chamber as placid chords
                        elucidate odd harmonies that try to escape but cannot,
                        like small islands. This happens over and over again
                        until finally, the harmony is able to escape and reach a
                        cadence in the major: unlike the Picardy thirds of the
                        baroque period, this change does not feel forced at all,
                        in my opinion, but rather feels more like the only
                        possible way out for the music, the truest (and also
                        happiest) ending. There, the right hand repeats its
                        major chord twice more, but I think does not insist on
                        it: rather, it feels more relieved to have reached its
                        final point of rest or escape, whereupon the music ends.

                    <h3 id="conc">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the last sonata that Beethoven wrote. After
                        this, he wrote to his publisher that &ldquo;the
                        pianoforte is, after all, an unsatisfactory
                        instrument&rdquo; (Tovey, 280): his Ninth Symphony,
                        Missa Solemnis, and five last string quartets are all
                        written for ensembles that are greater in number, in
                        size, and also somehow in expressive power than the
                        piano. His only other piano works past this point would
                        be the great Diabelli Variations, and the 6 Bagatelles,
                        op. 126. The last movement, in particular, is so
                        touching and meaningful that some have taken to calling
                        it a &ldquo;farewell to sonata form&rdquo;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this work serves as the conclusion of this series
                        of essays, not least because I don&rsquo;t have any more
                        time to write, I do not think that this should be a
                        farewell to the analysis of Beethoven&rsquo;s sonatas
                        and of his works in general. There are many other works
                        that I have failed to touch upon and that deserve
                        touching upon: not only the greats like the Moonlight,
                        Pastorale, Tempest, Waldstein, Appassionata, and
                        Hammerklavier, but also the little sonatas like No. 1 Op

                        ). All of these deserve at least a listen, or (if you
                        know how to play the piano) a play-through. Just like
                        the other works discussed, they also have strong forms
                        and underlying structures that are also worth analyzing:
                        this is where good books like Tovey&rsquo;s A Companion
                        to Beethoven&rsquo;s Pianoforte Sonatas (which is very
                        dense and has a lot of technical language) or
                        Fischer&rsquo;s Beethoven&rsquo;s Pianoforte Sonatas
                        (which is a lot more easygoing, but aimed at
                        piano-players), and the videos liked above have program
                        notes to help dissect the form as well. The ultimate
                        goal of these essays is not to be the be-all and end-all
                        work, but rather to serve as an introduction to the wide
                        world of music theory and music analysis that Beethoven
                        used to construct his works, and that give us deeper
                        insight into those works as well. Thus, I hope that this
                        will not serve as the conclusion but rather an
                        introduction to Beethoven. Thank you for reading!
