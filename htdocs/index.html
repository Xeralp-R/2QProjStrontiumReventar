                <h3>What is this website?</h3>
                <p>
                    This website analyzes the Sonatas of Beethoven in order to
                    gain insight into the form and structure of the pieces. I
                    believe by understanding those things, we also get to
                    understand better the way Beethoven created the emotions
                    conveyed in his music. The goal is to do this in a somewhat
                    approachable way, albeit some cursory knowledge of music is
                    recommended, for example the ability to read some sheet
                    music, or the knowledge of what a musical interval or a
                    chord is. I don't think I will delve too deeply into the
                    minute details of the music, but I still hope to be able to
                    offer a new perspective into his works. Lastly, the website
                    aims to see what we can discern about Beethoven and his life
                    and times by studying the sonatas that marked changes in his
                    writing style or climaxes in his style.

                    This website has 5 content pages, one for each of the
                    following sonata movements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Sonata No. 8, Op. 13, "Pathetique"; First Movement,
                        Grave — Allegro di molto e con brio

                        Sonata No. 21, Op. 53, "Waldstein"; First Movement,
                        Allegro con Brio
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a, "Les Adieux"; First Movement,
                        Adagio — Allegro
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sonata No. 29, Op. 106, "Hammerklavier"; Fourth
                        Movement, Largo — Allegro — Allegro risoluto
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each of those pages has an introduction and an analysis of
                    the respective movement: considering that the analysis goes
                    fairly in-depth, I have elected to choose only the most
                    iconic or most well-known movement, and have left out the
                    other movements for the sake of brevity. I have chosen these
                    sonatas both because they are particularly popular, and
                    because I like them very much and believe there is some
                    insight that can be gained by studying those pieces in
                    particular. Of the 5, the first 2 come from Beethoven's
                    early period, the next 2 come from his middle period, and
                    the last comes from his late period.

                <h3>Who was Beethoven?</h3>
                <p>
                    Beethoven was a german composer and pianist. He lived from
                    1770 to 1827, and helped propel music from the Classical Era
                    with its focus on lightness and musical form into the
                    Romantic Era with its focus on emotions and virtuosity. He
                    composed 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 16 string
                    quartets, and 32 piano sonatas. Whilst each sonata is worthy
                    of its own webpage, for the sake of brevity, this website
                    will only discuss 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was born in Bonn, Germany; both his father and his
                    grandfather were musicians, with his grandfather in
                    particular being particularly accomplished as a
                    <i>Kapellmeister</i>, or choir-director. However, his
                    grandfather died when he was 2 or 3, and his father fell
                    into alcoholism: thus, he had to leave school at 11 to work,
                    around the same time he made his first composition. And in
                    1789, when he would be around 18 years old, he became the
                    breadwinner of his family once he became a violist in the
                    Bonn court chapel. He stayed there for a few years until he
                    left for Vienna in 1792, when he would have been around 21
                    years old, to study with Haydn. However, only 2 years later
                    did the Napoleonic War reach Bonn, rendering the court
                    chapel closed and leaving Beethoven to stay in vienna for
                    the rest of his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His career as a composer really began in Vienna: for his
                    first 10 years there, he was a virtuoso, playing both his
                    own and Mozart's piano concerti. These first 10 years mark
                    his early period, and a closer look at them is provided on
                    the webpage regarding the Sonatas Pathetique and Moonlight,
                    both of which were published in that period. Other notable
                    pieces composed in that period would be his first and second
                    piano concerti, his first and second symphonies, and the
                    Funeral March and Pastoral Sonatas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, beginning in 1800, his hearing steadily began to
                    decline until he could hear very little. He grew more and
                    more agitated over the decline of his hearing and the
                    inability of the doctors to cure his illness until, in 1802,
                    he eventually was advised to go to Heiligenstadt, a tourist
                    destination with nice weather. There, he wrote the
                    Heiligenstadt Testament, where he grappled with the
                    conclusion that he was deaf. However, he swore to "take a
                    new path"— and so he did, marking the formal beginning of
                    his Middle Period. In this period, he composed some of his
                    most well-known works and developed a whole new style of
                    writing: while the 2 webpages on the Waldstein Sonata and
                    the Les Adieux Sonata cover some of the changes, he wrote
                    many other beautiful works such as the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
                    piano concerti and the 3rd until 8th symphonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, his health continued deteriorating, and eventually
                    he had to stop performing the piano altogether at around
                    1815. Furthermore, upon the death of one of his brothers, he
                    went into a legal argument over the custody of his brother's
                    son or his nephew, named Karl, against his brother's wife.
                    This put a halt to his composition. When he went back to
                    composing, he went on another new path, rediscovering for
                    himself the works of Handel and Bach who were composers from
                    a hundred years past: they served as his inspirations, with
                    his music eventually becoming more musically dense and more
                    difficult. He has only but a few compositions from this
                    period, the most notable of which being his Hammerklavier
                    Sonata, which has its own webpage: other important works
                    from this period would include his Diabelli Variations, his
                    Missa Solemnis, and his 9th Symphony, well known for its
                    chorale, Ode to Joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the last few months of 1826, when he was returning back
                    to Vienna from a trip elsewhere, he contracted pneumonia.
                    There, he stayed bedridden for some 3 months. His admirers
                    and patrons came over to bid their last farewells, and on 26
                    March 1826, he died of cirrhosis of the liver, caused by
                    alcoholism. His funeral was attended by somewhere between
                    10-20,000 people, with notables like Schubert attending as
                    torchbearer and Hummel attending as pallbearer. He was
                    buried in Währing, exhumed a little later for study, and
                    then reburied in the Vienna Central Cemetery next to
                    Schubert.

                <h3>What is a sonata?</h3>
                <p>
                    Taken literally, a sonata is a piece meant to be sounded on
                    an instrument (from the italian <i>sonare</i>, "to sound")
                    as opposed to the cantata, which is sung with the voice
                    (from the italian <i>cantare</i>, "to sing"). However, its
                    meaning has evolved since that time, and while cantatas are
                    only associated with the Baroque period, sonatas have become
                    a lot more common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Renaissance and Baroque periods, a sonata held its
                    original meaning of being played by an instrument or by
                    multiple instruments. However, even then, there were some
                    standards in the way sonatas were organized, much as they
                    were in the Classical Period going forwards. There were 2
                    types of sonatas that were predominant: the
                    <i>Sonata da Camera</i> and the <i>Sonata da Chiesa</i>. The
                    former, literally meaning "Chamber Sonata", was intended as
                    chamber music and was essentially a large collection of
                    dances. The latter, literally meaning "Church Sonata", was
                    thought appropriate for church but could also have been
                    played in a chamber setting; it had a strict form, with a
                    slow <i>introduzione</i>, a semi-fugal fast movement, then a
                    slow <i>cantabile</i> (meaning "in a singing style")
                    movement, then a very fast <i>finale</i>. Of the 2, the
                    <i>Sonata da Chiesa</i>
                    would be the one to eventually birth the modern sonata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, once the Classical period came around, new terms
                    were being used such as "suite" for a group of dances,
                    "divertimento" for light music, "serenade" for pieces in
                    honor of another, etc. And in that period, the
                    <i>Sonata da Chiesa</i> evolved: the slow first movement was
                    removed, the fugal elements in the fast second movement were
                    replaced with a new form called "sonata form", and the
                    <i>finale</i> was sometimes replaced with a dance— often a
                    minuet or a rondo. Sometimes, the minuet would be added in
                    along with a <i>finale</i>, making 4 movements: other times,
                    the fast final movement would be removed altogether, making
                    2 movements. It was in this framework that Beethoven
                    composed his sonatas, and we can trace exactly how his
                    sonatas fit in both with the classical sonata and the
                    baroque sonata.

                <h3>What is Sonata Form?</h3>
                <p>
                    Sonata form is a musical structure composed of 3 parts: the
                    introduction, the development, and the recapitulation. There
                    are many analogies that a person can use to describe sonata
                    form: for example, some have described it is a trip, where
                    two people go out on an adventure, get lost along the way,
                    and return home changed (a tripartite form). Another good
                    analogy that may be somewhat useful would be to think of it
                    as 3 boxes: the first has 2 shapes with 2 different colors
                    to represent the exposition, the second has the same 2
                    shapes but in many different colors and sizes to represent
                    the development, and the third has the 2 shapes again but
                    now in the same color to represent the recapitulation. The
                    idea is that its a tripartite form, and it has a beginning,
                    middle, and end, much like a story. What follows is an
                    analysis of one of the most well-known examples of sonata
                    form: Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16, K. 545, played by Simone
                    Renzi.

                    While some sonatas, especially Beethoven's, have
                    introductions, this sonata just starts off with the
                    exposition. The exposition showcases the 2 musical themes or
                    ideas that will be reused throughout the piece itself. On
                    the first line is the first theme: this theme is always set
                    in the tonic, or the home key, which in this case is C
                    Major. This can be seen because it starts the high C and
                    ends on high E, all of which are in the tone set of C major.
                    Starting on line 2, we have transition material: scales
                    going up and down and up and down. This transitions the key
                    from C Major to G Major, as evidenced by the last few chords
                    on the cut-off 4th line: they are all G Major chords, with
                    the last not being a G.

                <p>
                    What comes next is the second theme group of the Sonata,
                    also in the exposition. Now, something important about this
                    is that it's longer than the first theme: in fact, it's not
                    only 1 theme but many themes, all grouped together. These
                    combine to make a theme group. With Beethoven, there can be
                    some 2-3 themes in the second theme group, along with a
                    cadential theme: sometimes, the first theme is even restated
                    after the second theme, as with the Sonata Pathetique. For
                    this one, the first theme would comprise the 1st and 2nd
                    lines with the melody, the second theme the 3rd and 4th
                    lines with the arpeggios going around the circle of
                    fifths<sup id="footnote-1-ref"
                        ><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup
                    >, and the third theme with the acciaccaturas (or grace
                    notes) along with the cadential trill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, something of note is that there is a short coda, some 3
                    measures long, attached after the trill. A coda is when a
                    composer extends a piece after it resolves to the home key—
                    in this case, given that the home key is G because we're in
                    the second theme group, the trill resolves to G before we
                    have the coda. With Beethoven, both codas after the
                    exposition and codas after the end of the piece become a lot
                    longer, as we will see with the Waldstein Sonata.

                <p>
                    Now, something that should be noted is that this piece
                    repeats its exposition: this is something that was common in
                    the Classical period, but becomes less common with Beethoven
                    Sonatas, and I will specifically call out when the
                    exposition is repeated. In any case, this marks the
                    beginning of the development of the piece.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing that should be noted is that with Beethoven,
                    the development of a sonata becomes significantly longer and
                    significantly more important. However, in the Classical
                    period, more emphasis is placed on the exposition and
                    recapitulation. hat reflect quite well here, as the
                    development is short at less that 1/4 of the piece, and it
                    doesn't develop the thematic material much: it cannot be
                    discerned whether that was the style of Mozart, or whether
                    it was only because this piece was for beginners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, it begins with a restatement of the coda in G
                    Minor, which has the same center as the G Major in which the
                    exposition ended, only being in a minor or sad key. After
                    that, we have the scale motif split in the 2 hands, and we
                    reach D Minor, which is closely related to G Minor, as D is
                    the dominant<sup id="footnote-2-ref"
                        ><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup
                    >
                    of G. Again, we have a the scale motif for another 2 bars
                    until we reach the third line, and we get the scales going
                    down the circle of fifths, much as the arpeggios in the
                    second theme were. After that, the scales go down one more
                    time right before we reach the recapitulation.

                    The recapitulation states the 2 themes or theme groups
                    introduced at the beginning, but all in the home key. The
                    unique thing about this recapitulation is the fact that the
                    first theme doesn't begin on the home key, but instead on
                    the subdominant<sup id="footnote-3-ref"
                        ><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup
                    >
                    key of F Major: whilst somewhat uncommon, this allows for a
                    more symmetric form, with the subdominant reaching up to the
                    tonic much as the tonic to the dominant. Also, we see that
                    the restatement of the theme doesn't have to be perfect: in
                    this case, the transition scales are extended by 4 bars in
                    the left hand so as to return to G Major upon the recurrence
                    of the 2nd theme group. Beethoven also changes his bridges
                    and transitions often to ensure a smoother transition from
                    the first theme to the second.

                <p>
                    And finally, we come to the end: the second theme group,
                    stated in the tonic— i.e. C Major. Again, the recapitulation
                    of the second theme doesn't have to be a perfect
                    transposition: sometimes, some parts are altered for
                    convenience or to further the melodic ideas. For example,
                    the third theme group of the acciaccaturas isn't exactly
                    transposed from the previous example, but is instead
                    repeated twice to bring us to the right key for the ending
                    scale. Also, we have the ending coda: while in this piece,
                    its short at just 3 bars, the Coda in Beethoven's time
                    becomes much longer and much more intricate, sometimes even
                    restating the theme itself, as with the Waldstein sonata.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    And that concludes the discussion on sonata form! Now, it
                    should be noted that every analysis is imperfect, and that
                    there is still room for debate over whether any analysis is
                    right. Fow example, the scales in the above sonata could
                    just as easily been part of a "first theme group", or the
                    acciaccaturas could have been part of the coda. The goal of
                    analysis like this is to understand the music better, to see
                    how it tells its story or how it is best interpreted; and as
                    2 people can come away from the same painting with different
                    understandings of what the painter intended, so it goes with
                    the way we imagine and understand the sonatas of Beethoven:
                    they are merely what I, the author, see in them, combined
                    with the information and background contained in the
                    citations. The sonata form framework is just unique in the
                    way it constantly reappears in Beethoven's works, and so I
                    think understanding it is key to gaining insight into
                    Beethoven.

                        The Circle of Fifths is an arrangement of notes, with
                        the next note being a fifth higher than the last. Due to
                        the fact that 5 does not divide 8 nor 12, it will always
                        include every note on any scale, whether it be a major
                        scale, a minor scale, or a scale including all 12 notes,
                        called a chromatic scale.

                        which is called the tonic. It is the fifth scale degree
                        as well, meaning that the circle of fifths is a large
                        circle of dominants as well. The dominant has the unique
                        property of very much wanting to resolve to the tonic,
                        and most music is based off the dominant-tonic
                        relationship.

                        It is called the subdominant, because it is the dominant
                        below the tonic: the tonic is the dominant of the
                        subdominant. Due to this relationship, the circle of
                        fifths is also the circle of fourths, just in reverse.
