                    <p>
                        The Funeral March Sonata was composed in the year 1801,
                        a year when Beethoven was experimenting with the many
                        forms of classical music in his time: it was in the same
                        year that he composed the Moonlight Sonata (I have
                        elected not to give an analysis of this sonata because
                        others have already done this work for me: please refer

                        >, which was the product of mixing fantasies and
                        sonatas, along with the Pastoral Sonata, which is also
                        somewhat popular for its humorous and lighthearted
                        nature. This was also 1 year before he wrote the
                        Heiligenstadt Testament, as detailed in the
                        introduction— so this work can be considered in closer
                        nature to the middle sonatas rather than the earlier
                        classical sonatas of Beethoven. Indeed, Schiff places
                        the tipping point between the Early period and the
                        Middle period, at least concerning Beethoven's Piano
                        Sonatas, with the one right before this one, which is
                        Opus 22, Piano Sonata No. 11 in B flat major.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The piece itself is in 4 movements, matching the mold of
                        classical sonatas up until that time— however, the
                        similarities with the past essentially end there. For
                        one, if we look at its 4 movements, we see that none are
                        in sonata form. Furthermore, the first movement is a
                        theme and variations in the key of A-flat major: Schiff
                        states that the only precedent for this movement would
                        be the Mozart sonata in A Major, K331, which can be
                        found here on YouTube, which also has a slow first
                        movement in variation form and no movements in Sonata
                        form. The second movement is a scherzo and trio, a type
                        of light music in 3 parts, also in A flat major: while
                        Beethoven wrote many scherzi before and many after, what
                        is unique about this is that it is the second movement
                        when it usually is the third movement of a 4-movement
                        sonata. The same is true of the slow third movement,
                        which usually goes second— this movement is the namesake
                        Funeral March, which is in the parallel key of an A-flat
                        minor. Lastly, we have a fast fourth movement in the
                        usual rondo form. The unique thing about this sonata,
                        according to Kumar, would be its seeming disunity, with
                        the second, third, and fourth movements being completely
                        incongruous to each other, both in mood and in tone
                        color: instead, they are united by the first movement,
                        which foreshadows each movement with one of its
                        variations. Thus, merely by talking about this first
                        movement, we already gain insight into all of the
                        movements of this sonata.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I think a short introduction to the Theme and
                        Variations form should be in order, as the first
                        movement of this sonata is set in that form. As the name
                        suggests, this form begins with a theme, which is
                        usually fairly simple and unornamented. There are then
                        variations on that theme, each of which presents the
                        theme differently: they may change the harmony
                        underlying the theme to form what is called a harmonic
                        variation, they may add ornaments or embellishments in
                        an ornamental variation, they may change the melody
                        wholesale but not the harmony in a melodic variation, or
                        change both but still retain the primary elements is
                        what is called a character variation. This first
                        movement makes liberal use of character and ornamental
                        variations: for examples of melodic variations, I would
                        suggest a look at the Goldberg Variations, made by JS
                        Bach.

                        The theme begins with a regular 8 bar phrase, which is
                        very lyrical and expressive— indeed, I would say that it
                        is quite beautiful, perhaps slightly sentimental or
                        melancholic. This phrase was so great that Franz
                        Schubert, [an Austrian composer often considered as a
                        great lyricist and lieder or song maker and a great
                        admirer of Beethoven], is believed to have taken
                        inspiration from the theme in his Impromptu, Op. 142/2
                        (see

                        >). Even in its base form, this theme already has some
                        ornaments and embellishments, like the passing note and
                        the turn in the fourth bar: these sorts of things are
                        not uncommon in theme and variations form, and they
                        serve to emphasize the lyric quality of the piece. After
                        this, we repeat the same 8-bar phrase with a slight
                        variation, namely, that the eighth notes in the first
                        bar have been converted into sixteenth notes. This
                        slight change is usually accompanied by an
                        interpretational change in overall dynamic so that
                        things remain interesting, as is the natural
                        progression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we move on, I would like to take note of a minor
                        change that, while slightly less prominent and still
                        present in previous sonatas, still heralds a major
                        change in composition. If you take another look at the
                        score above, we see a large number of instructions like
                        staccatos, slurs, sforzandos, and crescendos. While
                        nowadays, it is presumed that the composer will mark out
                        every articulation or somehow indicate the articulation
                        otherwise, many of the predecessors of Beethoven would
                        instead presume that the player is intelligent enough to
                        place these sorts of articulations in the correct
                        locations, and would only write these things out for
                        beginners. This was the especially prevalent mood in the
                        Baroque period, where the composer would only have to
                        write forte or the type of piece and would then expect
                        the player to know the genre intimately enough to be
                        able to make the articulations on the fly. However,
                        starting with Beethoven, we get more and more
                        articulations being directed to evoke a particular sound
                        or mood, which may be contrary to the normal method of
                        playing. This goal of Beethoven, to communicate more and
                        more information to the player about how to play his
                        works rather than leaving it to their discretion, is one
                        of the trends that increase as Beethoven gets older,
                        with his late works even having German tempo markings
                        rather than Italian ones so that Beethoven can
                        communicate exactly what he wants. This trend continues
                        up to this day, especially in the period of
                        computer-generated audio samples: in these cases, the
                        computer will certainly not improvise nor interpret the
                        music, which essentially lends the composer as much
                        power over the music as he can realistically get.

                        After this, we now get the second phrase, which is not
                        in 8 bars but instead in 10: Schiff notes that this
                        theme contrasts the symmetrical with the asymmetrical, a
                        method of contrast that Beethoven also uses in his other
                        works. For the first 4 bars, the melody stays in the
                        bass voice while the upper voices play a countermelody
                        in thirds: this melody is syncopated, or it falls on the
                        upbeat of the previous bar rather than the downbeat of
                        the current bar. This syncopation is retained when the
                        melody is moved to the right hand in the fifth bar of
                        this part, which is on the second line: it goes on a
                        beautiful part-written fashion until we reach the
                        seventh bar, last best when we hear a cadential trill in
                        the soprano. But when this resolves on the eighth bar,
                        there is still a sense of incompleteness, because the
                        bass voice has ended on a C, which is the third above
                        the tonic; so it repeats that last bar so that we get a
                        proper resolution in A-flat. Repeating a purported
                        "failed cadence" is something that also reappears in
                        Beethoven's works— this can happen very elegantly, as in
                        this sonata, or more brusquely, as in the trio in the
                        scherzo of Beethoven's Hammerklavier, discussed
                        elsewhere. After this, the first theme is repeated in
                        the more ornamental form with only a few changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we look at the structure, we see that we began with
                        the first 8-bar phrase, repeated it, moved on to the
                        10-bar phrase, and then repeated the 8-bar phrase only
                        last time. If we assign letters to these phrases, moving
                        to a new letter whenever we get a new phrase, we get the
                        structure AABA. This is the same form taken by many
                        other themes in other similar works, most notably the
                        first movement of Mozart's A major sonata and the second
                        movement of Beethoven's own Kreutzer sonata, for violin
                        and piano: in this sense, it is a very classical theme,
                        and yet it already feels very Beethovenian. I think a
                        key to that would be the use of wide multiphony and
                        polyphony, even in this first movement: in Mozart's A
                        major sonata, the theme is very clear, as both hands are
                        playing the theme without accompaniment voices, and the
                        chords at the end of the theme feel rather heavy; this
                        work, however, already has four, five, or even six notes
                        sounding at once, so a change to only 2 voices sounding
                        in the B part feels very light in comparison. The other
                        key might be the usage of the damper pedal: Beethoven’s
                        works, such as this, are often played with great washes
                        of pedal, with the Master himself indicating in other
                        sonatas like the Waldstein to hold it for extreme
                        lengths; Mozart’s pieces are more often played without
                        pedal to give the notes a clarity that matches with the
                        clarion tunes that are played in that manner. Combined,
                        we see many of the hallmarks of Beethoven’s skill with
                        slow tunes appearing in this relatively early work.
                        Onwards to the first variation!

                        The first variation begins by having a variation on the
                        A part and then repeating that variation: this keeps in
                        line with the AABA structure of the theme, which is also
                        present in this variation. The theme itself features
                        “quartal writing”, or rather it feels like it is better
                        scored for a quartet: the reason for this is because it
                        makes use of the different registers of the piano which,
                        while fairly close to each other, more closely match
                        that of a string quartet. Quartal writing is also
                        present in many of Beethoven’s other sonatas. It also
                        makes use of a pattern for each melodic line or phrase:
                        an ascending run of 32nd notes, followed by 2 eight
                        notes, which give it a constant rhythm that switches
                        from exerting effort to relaxing a little. In Bar 35,
                        this rhythm is used in an upper bass context, giving it
                        the feel of a viola: this also occurs in Bar 37, and
                        Bars 41 and 43 on the second line. In the other bars,
                        this rhythm is used in a low treble or a high treble
                        context: these feel like the first and second violins
                        switching around their use of the melody. Lastly, to
                        fill out the quartet, the cello plays these bass notes
                        (here filled out to be chords) to ground the harmony
                        with rich tones as it did in the theme.

                        We now move on to the B and A parts of the second
                        variation. Beginning in the third line, counted as Bar
                        51, we see the right hand playing the same countermelody
                        as it did in the theme, and the left hand playing the
                        melody, this time ornamented and converted into the 32nd
                        note form as we have seen before. We also see that
                        Beethoven does not keep his rhythms static: he also
                        makes variations on them, as in bars 51-52 and bars
                        53-54 on the next line, we see that what were once
                        straight eight notes are now syncopated slightly,
                        emphasizing the long silence between, and we now also
                        have a downward tail in 32nd notes. Lastly, we also see
                        carefully placed sforzandi on the apex of the figure,
                        which emphasizes the interpretation where high notes and
                        ascending figures are played louder than low notes or
                        descending figures. If we had to assign an instrument to
                        this melody, we could probably give it the upper
                        register of a cello.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After those 4 bars, we get the 2 bars of new material:
                        what were once straight octaves are now broken octaves,
                        yet another technique that is idiomatic for violin as it
                        emphasizes string crossings and thus the subtle
                        differences in timbre between the strings. We then get
                        the four-bar extended cadence, which runs into the third
                        line of the above excerpt: the lowest voice plays fast
                        upward staccato notes, reminiscent of an upbow or
                        downbow staccato on the cello, as the upper voices play
                        the corresponding cadential chords. And finally, after
                        the transitional passage also reminiscent of
                        string-crossings on the violin in bar 60, we repeat the
                        A phrase in much the same manner as we did previously.
                        Overall, we can say that this variation does not stray
                        far from the first in tone or mood: instead, it feels
                        like the natural extension of the first, much as
                        classical variations were. We see that Beethoven was
                        very well-acquainted with the forms of his time, which
                        is what allowed him to begin pushing back on them.

                        As you might have heard from the audio or seen in the
                        score, almost the entire piece is played in staccato:
                        rather than the string instruments of the previous
                        variation, this one seems better suited either for
                        woodwinds or the piano, as it can be difficult to
                        coordinate instruments playing in such syncopated
                        manners. Regarding the music itself, the melody has
                        moved to the bass: it can be difficult to see, but if
                        you can look at the circled notes in the following
                        excerpt from the bass of bars 69 to 72 and this excerpt
                        from the theme in bars 1 to 5 of the theme, we see that
                        they have the same contour, and are just the same notes
                        transposed down an octave.

                            the treble clef, while the variation is in the bass
                            clef.

                        The right hand now plays an accompanying figure, that
                        being repeated staccato chords either in smaller thirds
                        and fourths or (on the second repetition) in larger
                        octaves: these chords are syncopated, which Schiff
                        states adds a small element of humor to this variation.
                        If we recall the statements I made in the introduction,
                        this variation best mimics the scherzo, according to
                        Kumar; the second movement of this sonata is also laden
                        with staccato figures, and with some light humor, like
                        the never-ending dominant preparation which begins in
                        bar 25 and does not let down for another 20 bars, and
                        the sudden “wrong entry” at the end of all that
                        preparation. Thus, this variation can be taken to
                        foreshadow that, in a sense.

                        Something we should note before continuing would be the
                        fact that different people can play this variation very
                        differently and thus cause it to feel very different. On
                        the one hand, you can choose to play this variation very
                        quickly, as Kovacevich and Barenboim do: it then sounds
                        somewhat exciting and fun, as if one would be bouncing
                        around and enjoying themself. On the other hand, you can
                        choose to play this variation on the slow side, as Lewis
                        and Buchbinder do: it then sounds a little bit more
                        languid, like a jog in the park. I believe it sounds
                        good in both cases, but you, the reader, will decide
                        which one you prefer.

                        Here, for the B part of this variation, the melody moves
                        in the right hand: this makes it feel even more
                        syncopated, as now none of the melody notes fall on any
                        of the downbeats of the measure. It also retains its
                        previous voicing, so to speak, with only 1 line of
                        notes— now playing the decomposed form of the
                        countermelody, they jump around in the left hand except
                        at important points where they turn into full octaves.
                        After that, we get a repeat of the A part with even more
                        fully-voiced right-hand chords and a slightly changed
                        melody in the left hand, all jumping around until the
                        end.

                        We should note that this sort of pointillistic and
                        deconstructionistic method is not uncommon in
                        Beethoven’s other pieces in theme and variations form:

                        to account for the faster tempo; something very similar

                        , which also decomposes its theme into small parts; and
                        lastly, if we want to push the limit of
                        deconstructionist tendencies, we can take a look at the

                        or variation 23 of the same set, which, while not
                        keeping with the right-hand left-hand alternating
                        pattern of this variation, still sound reminiscent
                        because of the repeated notes (or chords) in the hand
                        that it playing the variation on the melody. So this is
                        most certainly not a bolt from the blue for Beethoven:
                        this is only 1 of the techniques that he has in his
                        arsenal and that he uses for his themes and variations.

                    <p>
                        We have now arrived at the minor variation. In the
                        classical period, a variation in the minor when the
                        theme is in the major would be marked “minore”, meaning
                        minor in Italian. And quite the minor it is! While
                        A-flat major has 4 flats and is just on the border of
                        what is considered easy to read by amateurs, A-flat
                        minor has 7 flats, the most of any normal key: every
                        note is flattened, which makes it quite a bit more
                        difficult for amateurs to read. Indeed, before
                        Beethoven’s time, key signatures with more than 4 flats
                        or sharps were avoided because the tuning system of the
                        day simply meant that these keys sounded terrible and
                        dissonant: even when corrected with the equal-tempered
                        tuning method that was already quite popular at the
                        time, these keys were still avoided and were associated
                        with death and lament, concepts which were also oft
                        avoided. It was only really in the romantic period after
                        Beethoven that these extremely flat or extremely sharp
                        keys took hold, especially in the music of Chopin which
                        became popular after Beethoven died. So, even starting
                        with the key signature at the beginning of the piece, it
                        already makes serious breakthroughs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to the music itself, I think it is quite
                        obvious that the mood of this piece is very heavy: it
                        evokes a variety of sad emotions which are difficult to
                        place labels on, ranging from sorrow to pathos to anger.
                        In the first A part, this sorrow is more reserved: the
                        piano dynamic and the great washes of pedal hide and
                        obscure much of the sorrow that is laden in the piece,
                        along with the thinner voicing: this part can be played
                        by just 1 hand that has the span of an octave, although
                        thankfully Beethoven allows us to divide the part in 2.
                        However, the second A part is much more sorrowful or
                        perhaps ominous: the sforzandi pedal note all the way in
                        the double-low or contra octave add a lot to the
                        atmosphere of the piece, with Schiff calling them
                        menacing or even threatening. These bass notes can even
                        cover up the actual melody in the right hand, which
                        makes them even scarier. In all, even just the start of
                        this variation already heralds Beethoven&apos;s skill at
                        composing in minor keys.

                        If we take a look at the upbeat to the first bar of the
                        B part, we see a B-double flat: the next notes are a
                        chord composed of E-flat and G-flat. But we should note
                        that the relationship between a B-double flat (or an A)
                        and E-flat form a tritone, an extremely dissonant
                        interval— in fact, it is considered the most dissonant
                        along with the minor second, or the half-step. There is
                        no doubt that tritones have been used very often before
                        in music: they take part in the dominant fifth, which is
                        a very common chord. However, the fact that in this
                        sonata, they are being given serious prominence to even
                        take up a melody position is something very
                        groundbreaking and harmonically innovative, as Schiff
                        puts it. So this piece really pushed our musical
                        understanding forward on the possible uses of
                        dissonances, and really reflects the romantic usage of
                        dissonance. This continues on in the actual bar when the
                        C-natural of the left-hand forms a tritone with the
                        G-flat of the right, and goes on in the repetition of
                        the phrase in bar 121 with the G-natural of the bass
                        clashing with the D-flat of the treble. All of this
                        dissonance gives this part great amounts of negative
                        emotion: whether it be pathos or fear is up to the
                        reader to decide. After that, we get a variation on the
                        previous rhythmic pattern, with a 16th note on the 3rd
                        beat contrasted by another sforzando 16th note on the
                        upbeat: this really emphasizes the upbeat and
                        strengthens the syncopations that were already there,
                        making the music feel even more bent. This new rhythm
                        continues on for 6 bars of the transitory passage until
                        we get back to the home key of A-flat, upon which we
                        restate the A part and fade away to nothingness.

                        As I previously mentioned, each variation in this set
                        foreshadows a movement in this sonata. And while the
                        previous variation had authors disagreeing, here
                        essentially all sources that I have seen agree that this
                        foreshadows the 3rd movement, which is the namesake
                        funeral march. They have a large number of similarities:
                        the A-flat minor key signature is the most prominent
                        one, but also the liberal use of staccato (often
                        overshadowed by the liberal and justified use of pedal
                        by performers and interpreters), the great block chords
                        in the right hand as the left hand plays
                        countermelodies, even the use of sforzandi and
                        fortissimi closely reflect each other. There is one
                        final thing that both share: a climax that grows louder
                        and louder, reaching its loudest on the dominant before
                        suddenly petering out right then ending on a soft note,
                        in a sense dying out. It’s difficult for me to say
                        exactly when this practice began: Haydn’s Variations in
                        F minor, which many believe had a lot of influence on
                        Beethoven, seems to have a technique like this on a
                        picardy third [a type of chord at the end of a piece
                        where the chord is sharpened, making the last note major
                        rather than minor], and Mozart’s Confutatis in his
                        celebrated Requiem has something similar, but I think it
                        was really Beethoven that began using this technique
                        regularly and often (primarily because classical
                        composers did not write a lot of pieces in minor keys)
                        and his influence propagated the effects of this on
                        essentially all romantic music, most notably with
                        Chopin’s famous
                        <a

                        that took a lot of inspiration from this one. So all in
                        all, I would say that the effects of this sonata are
                        varied and widespread.

                        This variation is almost wholly different from the
                        variation that preceded it, as the last one was to the
                        variation that preceded it. In fact, this variation
                        shares a lot of characteristics with Variazione II, in
                        that both are light and humorous, rather than serious
                        and grave. The feeling of this variation also heavily
                        depends on the interpreter: Kumar states that when
                        played slowly, it feels more ironic and funny, “like a
                        heavy person trying to dance a ballet”, to use an odd
                        metaphor; when played quickly, it feels like more a
                        scherzo. As always, the choice of which interpretation
                        you prefer is up to the reader.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to the music itself, it is much like
                        Variazione I in that it liberally uses the different
                        registers of a piano, in this case in a more light way
                        than the previous variations. While the register-writing
                        for the first variation seems to be well-suited for the
                        string quartet, this register writing seems to fit the
                        woodwind section very well: the clarinet, oboe, and
                        flute seem to be trading off the melody in the right
                        hand, with the timbral differences allowing the
                        syncopations to shine through that are difficult to hear
                        on the piano; the bassoon, french horn, and perhaps the
                        clarinet playing the left-hand countermelody, which also
                        uses the different bass registers to great effect. As
                        always, there are two A parts: the first A part has
                        unison melodies running over a eighth-note bass: the
                        second a part has the melody in octaves running over an
                        interrupted 16th note bass. Lastly, we see the texture
                        shift when moving from the first A part to the second,
                        with the pianist being asked to play legato: so we see
                        that Beethoven could use shifts in texture very well to
                        keep the music from becoming stale.

                        After that, we get the B part, where the first 4 bars
                        are played in the same syncopated staccato manner. After
                        that, the 6 bar transitory passage is played, with a
                        series of syncopated resolutions, with the key chord
                        always falling on the middle beat: I feel as though this
                        part sounds especially jaunty, as the “resolutions” go
                        up and up the keyboard’s register. This variation
                        especially gives us insight into the harmonic structure
                        of the theme: if one were to do a harmonic analysis of
                        this piece (regrettably, I was unable to find one over
                        the internet), this variation might be very useful in
                        determining that. After that, we get a fast bass scale
                        (which also has a slight element of humor, as the bass
                        tones sound very clunky when attempting to play such a
                        light scale so quickly), we repeat the A part with few
                        changes from the second repetition, and then close this
                        penultimate variation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This variation is unlike the previous variation in one
                        last way: while authors all agree that the previous
                        variation most reflects the funeral march, authors
                        disagree on whether this variation reflects the second
                        movement, which is the scherzo that has already been
                        compared to the 2nd variation, or the fourth movement,
                        which is a wonderful rondo. I think the answer to this
                        depends on the interpretation of the player: if this
                        variation is played more slowly and the last movement
                        also played in a graceful and slow-paced way, this might
                        better match the last movement: however, if this
                        variation is played more quickly, it will better match
                        the second movement. Overall, I think that this
                        variation best matches the second movement, in the light
                        of Variazione V which best matches the final movement,
                        but as always, the reader is free to draw their own
                        conclusions.

                        And so we come to the last variation. Much as Variazione
                        IV used the same register-writing technique as
                        Variazione I, only applied with a different mood and
                        style, this variation uses the same deconstructionist
                        technique as Variazione II: but this time, rather than
                        the woodwinds that were playing the second variation,
                        this one seems best scored for strings or string and
                        orchestra, as best befits the finale to this set of
                        variations. Indeed, the path of this set of variations
                        is remarked to be elliptical: it goes out and out until
                        it reaches the furthest from the theme, in Variazione
                        III, the goes back closer and closer, reflecting
                        everything that came before. And as the melody in the
                        second variation was placed in the bass, the melody here
                        is hidden in the alto voice: an analysis of the triplets
                        in the first A part shows that it has a constant
                        pattern, with a pedal note followed by a non-chord,
                        embellishing tone (it’s difficult to say whether this is
                        a passing tone or a neighbor tone) and then followed by
                        the actual melody, while the second A part has the
                        melody clearly marked with the second voice. You can see
                        the diagram below to see the melody tones in the first A
                        part, which have been highlighted— they are the exact
                        same as in the first variation.

                    <p>
                        There is also another technique used in the first half
                        of this final variation that differentiates the first A
                        part from the second A part: while the first A uses
                        triplet 16th notes, the second speeds up to using 32nd
                        notes, which make it feel like the melody is climaxing
                        or blossoming into something that I find quite
                        beautiful. This part is usually played with a great wash
                        of pedal and wonderful dynamics that only add the the
                        beauty of the piece, and all add to the orchestral
                        coloration of this piece— it really does feel like the
                        whole orchestra is now playing this variation with great
                        emotion and strength. Indeed, these sorts of textures
                        were revisited and brought to fullness by the late
                        Beethoven some 20 years later, in his 30th Sonata, Opus
                        109: there, we get to see the full progression of the
                        theme in the final movement’s fourth variation, starting
                        from its quarter-note chorale nature and progressing to
                        eighth-notes, eight-note triplets, 16th-notes,
                        32nd-notes, and then finally reaching its climax at the
                        trill, played as quickly as possible before dying down
                        and restating the chorale theme.

                        When we reach the B part, in order to distinguish it
                        from the previous thickly orchestrated A parts,
                        Beethoven writes more thinly: he first writes the melody
                        in a higher register, which naturally cannot sustain as
                        long as the bass tones on the piano, and then he writes
                        in many rests, which give it a lighter feel compared to
                        the weightiness of the previous part. After those first
                        four bars, we get back to the six bar transitory
                        passage, where he places a running 32nd-note
                        counterpoint in the alto voice that outlines the melody
                        quite well, in my opinion, and prepares us for the last
                        restatement of the A part. Unlike previous variations,
                        where this last A part was essentially the same as the
                        second, this one has some key differences: while much of
                        the accompaniment is the same, the melody is switched to
                        the 16th note version, meaning that it feels fuller and
                        faster than the second A part. And after that final run,
                        we begin to rest and dial back: the alto voice returns
                        to accompaniment duties, playing 16th-note chords over
                        and over again as the bass plays a countermelody in
                        staccato that Schiff remarks is much like the pizzicato
                        of cellos and double-basses. And as we decrescendo from
                        the climax in the last part, we hear a wonderful (and
                        quite beautiful, if I do say so myself) melody in the
                        soprano: it feels a little bit like a lullaby, slowly
                        softening and softening until we reach the end of the
                        piece, hit the final home chord played pianissimo or
                        extremely softly, and go to sleep, marking the end of
                        this first movement.

                    <p>
                        At the time, this sonata was extremely popular: it was
                        one of the only sonatas by Beethoven that today we know
                        have been publicly played for audiences, which was
                        unusual at the time because sonatas were regularly only
                        played for private audiences, as befitted the more
                        intimate understanding of the classicists of the sonata.
                        The funeral march in particular was an instant hit, even
                        going so far as to be played at Beethoven’s funeral. It
                        also inspired many other composers of the time: I have
                        already mentioned Schubert, who was very much an ardent
                        Beethoven fan, but it also inspired Chopin, who was more
                        ambivalent and lukewarm about Beethoven: this A-flat
                        major sonata was reportedly the only one Chopin played
                        at his audiences and salons, and he liked it so much
                        that it served as inspiration for his own 2nd sonata,
                        which is also well-known for the funeral march in its
                        third movement (the perennially popular
                        <a

                            >Funeral March in B-flat minor</a
                        >, another extremely flat key). And there, we get to see
                        the difference between Chopin and Beethoven: I feel like
                        Beethoven’s funeral march is a lot warmer, because its
                        cadences are strong and loud discounting the last, final
                        cadence, which is somewhat eerie— all the cadences of
                        Chopin, however, are soft, giving all of them the tragic
                        quality that was only afforded to the last cadence in
                        Beethoven’s march. But notwithstanding that, we see that
                        it had a large effect on Beethoven’s contemporaries.

                        Regrettably, it is nowhere as popular now. Joachim
                        Kaiser, an active music critic, notes that it might have
                        been its elegant and sentimental character that made it
                        excellent for the people living budding romantic period
                        in which time Beethoven composed that make it more
                        neglected today, being a victim of oversentimentality:
                        much as the colder Appassionata sonata shines over the
                        warmer Les Adieux, so it is with the colder Moonlight
                        sonata, composed in the same year, over this warmer
                        Funeral March sonata. However, I think it still has its
                        virtues despite being a little oversentimental because
                        it reflects a fonder view of life, one that, while
                        marred by sorrow, still manages to look on the bright
                        side. And that is why I consider it one of Beethoven’s
                        seminal works even up to today. Thank you!
