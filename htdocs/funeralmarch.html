                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The Funeral March Sonata was composed in the year 1801, a
                    year when Beethoven was experimenting with the many forms of
                    classical music in his time: it was in the same year that he
                    composed the Moonlight Sonata (I have elected not to give an
                    analysis of this sonata because others have already done
                    this work for me: please refer

                    >, which was the product of mixing fantasies and sonatas,
                    along with the Pastoral Sonata, which is also somewhat
                    popular for its humorous and lighthearted nature. This was
                    also 1 year before he wrote the Heiligenstadt Testament, as
                    detailed in the introduction— so this work can be considered
                    in closer nature to the middle sonatas rather than the
                    earlier classical sonatas of Beethoven. Indeed, Schiff
                    places the tipping point between the Early period and the
                    Middle period, at least concerning Beethoven's Piano
                    Sonatas, with the one right before this one, which is Opus
                    22, Piano Sonata No. 11 in B flat major.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The piece itself is in 4 movements, matching the mold of
                    classical sonatas up until that time— however, the
                    similarities with the past essentially end there. For one,
                    if we look at its 4 movements, we see that none are in
                    sonata form. Furthermore, the first movement is a theme and
                    variations in the key of A-flat major: Schiff states that
                    the only precedent for this movement would be the Mozart
                    sonata in A Major, K331, which can be found here on YouTube,
                    which also has a slow first movement in variation form and
                    no movements in Sonata form. The second movement is a
                    scherzo and trio, a type of light music in 3 parts, also in
                    A flat major: while Beethoven wrote many scherzi before and
                    many after, what is unique about this is that it is the
                    second movement when it usually is the third movement of a
                    4-movement sonata. The same is true of the slow third
                    movement, which usually goes second— this movement is the
                    namesake Funeral March, which is in the parallel key of an
                    A-flat minor. Lastly, we have a fast fourth movement in the
                    usual rondo form. The unique thing about this sonata,
                    according to Kumar, would be its seeming disunity, with the
                    second, third, and fourth movements being completely
                    incongruous to each other, both in mood and in tone color:
                    instead, they are united by the first movement, which
                    foreshadows each movement with one of its variations. Thus,
                    merely by talking about this first movement, we already gain
                    insight into all of the movements of this sonata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I think a short introduction to the Theme and
                    Variations form should be in order, as the first movement of
                    this sonata is set in that form. As the name suggests, this
                    form begins with a theme, which is usually fairly simple and
                    unornamented. There are then variations on that theme, each
                    of which presents the theme differently: they may change the
                    harmony underlying the theme to form what is called a
                    harmonic variation, they may add ornaments or embellishments
                    in an ornamental variation, they may change the melody
                    wholesale but not the harmony in a melodic variation, or
                    change both but still retain the primary elements is what is
                    called a character variation. This first movement makes
                    liberal use of character and ornamental variations: for
                    examples of melodic variations, I would suggest a look at
                    the Goldberg Variations, made by JS Bach.

                <p>
                    The theme begins with a regular 8 bar phrase, which is very
                    lyrical and expressive— indeed, I would say that it is quite
                    beautiful, perhaps slightly sentimental or melancholic. This
                    phrase was so great that Franz Schubert, [an Austrian
                    composer often considered as a great lyricist and lieder or
                    song maker and a great admirer of Beethoven], is believed to
                    have taken inspiration from the theme in his Impromptu, Op.
                    142/2 (see
                    <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/38-S2bRo5rM"

                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >https://youtu.be/38-S2bRo5rM</a
                    >) and in his Sonata in C minor (see
                    <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/ltvKcZ9U5QA"
                        target="”_blank”"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        >https://youtu.be/ltvKcZ9U5QA</a
                    >). Even in its base form, this theme already has some
                    ornaments and embellishments, like the passing note and the
                    turn in the fourth bar: these sorts of things are not
                    uncommon in theme and variations form, and they serve to
                    emphasize the lyric quality of the piece. After this, we
                    repeat the same 8-bar phrase with a slight variation,
                    namely, that the eighth notes in the first bar have been
                    converted into sixteenth notes. This slight change is
                    usually accompanied by an interpretational change in overall
                    dynamic so that things remain interesting, as is the natural
                    progression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we move on, I would like to take note of a minor
                    change that, while slightly less prominent and still present
                    in previous sonatas, still heralds a major change in
                    composition. If you take another look at the score above, we
                    see a large number of instructions like staccatos, slurs,
                    sforzandos, and crescendos. While nowadays, it is presumed
                    that the composer will mark out every articulation or
                    somehow indicate the articulation otherwise, many of the
                    predecessors of Beethoven would instead presume that the
                    player is intelligent enough to place these sorts of
                    articulations in the correct locations, and would only write
                    these things out for beginners. This was the especially
                    prevalent mood in the Baroque period, where the composer
                    would only have to write forte or the type of piece and
                    would then expect the player to know the genre intimately
                    enough to be able to make the articulations on the fly.
                    However, starting with Beethoven, we get more and more
                    articulations being directed to evoke a particular sound or
                    mood, which may be contrary to the normal method of playing.
                    This goal of Beethoven, to communicate more and more
                    information to the player about how to play his works rather
                    than leaving it to their discretion, is one of the trends
                    that increase as Beethoven gets older, with his late works
                    even having German tempo markings rather than Italian ones
                    so that Beethoven can communicate exactly what he wants.
                    This trend continues up to this day, especially in the
                    period of computer-generated audio samples: in these cases,
                    the computer will certainly not improvise nor interpret the
                    music, which essentially lends the composer as much power
                    over the music as he can realistically get.

                <p>
                    After this, we now get the second phrase, which is not in 8
                    bars but instead in 10: Schiff notes that this theme
                    contrasts the symmetrical with the asymmetrical, a method of
                    contrast that Beethoven also uses in his other works. For
                    the first 4 bars, the melody stays in the bass voice while
                    the upper voices play a countermelody in thirds: this melody
                    is syncopated, or it falls on the upbeat of the previous bar
                    rather than the downbeat of the current bar. This
                    syncopation is retained when the melody is moved to the
                    right hand in the fifth bar of this part, which is on the
                    second line: it goes on a beautiful part-written fashion
                    until we reach the seventh bar, last best when we hear a
                    cadential trill in the soprano. But when this resolves on
                    the eighth bar, there is still a sense of incompleteness,
                    because the bass voice has ended on a C, which is the third
                    above the tonic; so it repeats that last bar so that we get
                    a proper resolution in A-flat. Repeating a purported "failed
                    cadence" is something that also reappears in Beethoven's
                    works— this can happen very elegantly, as in this sonata, or
                    more brusquely, as in the trio in the scherzo of Beethoven's
                    Hammerklavier, discussed elsewhere. After this, the first
                    theme is repeated in the more ornamental form with only a
                    few changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we look at the structure, we see that we began with the
                    first 8-bar phrase, repeated it, moved on to the 10-bar
                    phrase, and then repeated the 8-bar phrase only last time.
                    If we assign letters to these phrases, moving to a new
                    letter whenever we get a new phrase, we get the structure
                    AABA. This is the same form taken by many other themes in
                    other similar works, most notably the first movement of
                    Mozart's A major sonata and the second movement of
                    Beethoven's own Kreutzer sonata, for violin and piano: in
                    this sense, it is a very classical theme, and yet it already
                    feels very Beethovenian. I think a key to that would be the
                    use of wide multiphony and polyphony, even in this first
                    movement: in Mozart's A major sonata, the theme is very
                    clear, as both hands are playing the theme without
                    accompaniment voices, and the chords at the end of the theme
                    feel rather heavy; this work, however, already has four,
                    five, or even six notes sounding at once, so a change to
                    only 2 voices sounding in the B part feels very light in
                    comparison. The other key might be the usage of the damper
                    pedal: Beethoven’s works, such as this, are often played
                    with great washes of pedal, with the Master himself
                    indicating in other sonatas like the Waldstein to hold it
                    for extreme lengths; Mozart’s pieces are more often played
                    without pedal to give the notes a clarity that matches with
                    the clarion tunes that are played in that manner. Combined,
                    we see many of the hallmarks of Beethoven’s skill with slow
                    tunes appearing in this relatively early work. Onwards to
                    the first variation!

                    The first variation begins by having a variation on the A
                    part and then repeating that variation: this keeps in line
                    with the AABA structure of the theme, which is also present
                    in this variation. The theme itself features “quartal
                    writing”, or rather it feels like it is better scored for a
                    quartet: the reason for this is because it makes use of the
                    different registers of the piano which, while fairly close
                    to each other, more closely match that of a string quartet.
                    Quartal writing is also present in many of Beethoven’s other
                    sonatas. It also makes use of a pattern for each melodic
                    line or phrase: an ascending run of 32nd notes, followed by
                    2 eight notes, which give it a constant rhythm that switches
                    from exerting effort to relaxing a little. In Bar 35, this
                    rhythm is used in an upper bass context, giving it the feel
                    of a viola: this also occurs in Bar 37, and Bars 41 and 43
                    on the second line. In the other bars, this rhythm is used
                    in a low treble or a high treble context: these feel like
                    the first and second violins switching around their use of
                    the melody. Lastly, to fill out the quartet, the cello plays
                    these bass notes (here filled out to be chords) to ground
                    the harmony with rich tones as it did in the theme.

                    We now move on to the B and A parts of the second variation.
                    Beginning in the third line, counted as Bar 51, we see the
                    right hand playing the same countermelody as it did in the
                    theme, and the left hand playing the melody, this time
                    ornamented and converted into the 32nd note form as we have
                    seen before. We also see that Beethoven does not keep his
                    rhythms static: he also makes variations on them, as in bars
                    51-52 and bars 53-54 on the next line, we see that what were
                    once straight eight notes are now syncopated slightly,
                    emphasizing the long silence between, and we now also have a
                    downward tail in 32nd notes. Lastly, we also see carefully
                    placed sforzandi on the apex of the figure, which emphasizes
                    the interpretation where high notes and ascending figures
                    are played louder than low notes or descending figures. If
                    we had to assign an instrument to this melody, we could
                    probably give it the upper register of a cello.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After those 4 bars, we get the 2 bars of new material: what
                    were once straight octaves are now broken octaves, yet
                    another technique that is idiomatic for violin as it
                    emphasizes string crossings and thus the subtle differences
                    in timbre between the strings. We then get the four-bar
                    extended cadence, which runs into the third line of the
                    above excerpt: the lowest voice plays fast upward staccato
                    notes, reminiscent of an upbow or downbow staccato on the
                    cello, as the upper voices play the corresponding cadential
                    chords. And finally, after the transitional passage also
                    reminiscent of string-crossings on the violin in bar 60, we
                    repeat the A phrase in much the same manner as we did
                    previously. Overall, we can say that this variation does not
                    stray far from the first in tone or mood: instead, it feels
                    like the natural extension of the first, much as classical
                    variations were. We see that Beethoven was very
                    well-acquainted with the forms of his time, which is what
                    allowed him to begin pushing back on them.

                    As you might have heard from the audio or seen in the score,
                    almost the entire piece is played in staccato: rather than
                    the string instruments of the previous variation, this one
                    seems better suited either for woodwinds or the piano, as it
                    can be difficult to coordinate instruments playing in such
                    syncopated manners. Regarding the music itself, the melody
                    has moved to the bass: it can be difficult to see, but if
                    you can look at the circled notes in the following excerpt
                    from the bass of bars 69 to 72 and this excerpt from the
                    theme in bars 1 to 5 of the theme, we see that they have the
                    same contour, and are just the same notes transposed down an
                    octave.

                        should be noted that the theme is in the treble clef,
                        while the variation is in the bass clef.

                    The right hand now plays an accompanying figure, that being
                    repeated staccato chords either in smaller thirds and
                    fourths or (on the second repetition) in larger octaves:
                    these chords are syncopated, which Schiff states adds a
                    small element of humor to this variation. If we recall the
                    statements I made in the introduction, this variation best
                    mimics the scherzo, according to Kumar; the second movement
                    of this sonata is also laden with staccato figures, and with
                    some light humor, like the never-ending dominant preparation
                    which begins in bar 25 and does not let down for another 20
                    bars, and the sudden “wrong entry” at the end of all that
                    preparation. Thus, this variation can be taken to foreshadow
                    that, in a sense.

                    Something we should note before continuing would be the fact
                    that different people can play this variation very
                    differently and thus cause it to feel very different. On the
                    one hand, you can choose to play this variation very
                    quickly, as Kovacevich and Barenboim do: it then sounds
                    somewhat exciting and fun, as if one would be bouncing
                    around and enjoying themself. On the other hand, you can
                    choose to play this variation on the slow side, as Lewis and
                    Buchbinder do: it then sounds a little bit more languid,
                    like a jog in the park. I believe it sounds good in both
                    cases, but you, the reader, will decide which one you
                    prefer.

                    Here, for the B part of this variation, the melody moves in
                    the right hand: this makes it feel even more syncopated, as
                    now none of the melody notes fall on any of the downbeats of
                    the measure. It also retains its previous voicing, so to
                    speak, with only 1 line of notes— now playing the decomposed
                    form of the countermelody, they jump around in the left hand
                    except at important points where they turn into full
                    octaves. After that, we get a repeat of the A part with even
                    more fully-voiced right-hand chords and a slightly changed
                    melody in the left hand, all jumping around until the end.

                    We should note that this sort of pointillistic and
                    deconstructionistic method is not uncommon in Beethoven’s
                    other pieces in theme and variations form: for example, the

                    account for the faster tempo; something very similar occurs

                    , which also decomposes its theme into small parts; and
                    lastly, if we want to push the limit of deconstructionist
                    tendencies, we can take a look at the

                    or variation 23 of the same set, which, while not keeping
                    with the right-hand left-hand alternating pattern of this
                    variation, still sound reminiscent because of the repeated
                    notes (or chords) in the hand that it playing the variation
                    on the melody. So this is most certainly not a bolt from the
                    blue for Beethoven: this is only 1 of the techniques that he
                    has in his arsenal and that he uses for his themes and
                    variations.

                <p>
                    We have now arrived at the minor variation. In the classical
                    period, a variation in the minor when the theme is in the
                    major would be marked “minore”, meaning minor in Italian.
                    And quite the minor it is! While A-flat major has 4 flats
                    and is just on the border of what is considered easy to read
                    by amateurs, A-flat minor has 7 flats, the most of any
                    normal key: every note is flattened, which makes it quite a
                    bit more difficult for amateurs to read. Indeed, before
                    Beethoven’s time, key signatures with more than 4 flats or
                    sharps were avoided because the tuning system of the day
                    simply meant that these keys sounded terrible and dissonant:
                    even when corrected with the equal-tempered tuning method
                    that was already quite popular at the time, these keys were
                    still avoided and were associated with death and lament,
                    concepts which were also oft avoided. It was only really in
                    the romantic period after Beethoven that these extremely
                    flat or extremely sharp keys took hold, especially in the
                    music of Chopin which became popular after Beethoven died.
                    So, even starting with the key signature at the beginning of
                    the piece, it already makes serious breakthroughs.

                <p>
                    With regards to the music itself, I think it is quite
                    obvious that the mood of this piece is very heavy: it evokes
                    a variety of sad emotions which are difficult to place
                    labels on, ranging from sorrow to pathos to anger. In the
                    first A part, this sorrow is more reserved: the piano
                    dynamic and the great washes of pedal hide and obscure much
                    of the sorrow that is laden in the piece, along with the
                    thinner voicing: this part can be played by just 1 hand that
                    has the span of an octave, although thankfully Beethoven
                    allows us to divide the part in 2. However, the second A
                    part is much more sorrowful or perhaps ominous: the
                    sforzandi pedal note all the way in the double-low or contra
                    octave add a lot to the atmosphere of the piece, with Schiff
                    calling them menacing or even threatening. These bass notes
                    can even cover up the actual melody in the right hand, which
                    makes them even scarier. In all, even just the start of this
                    variation already heralds Beethoven&apos;s skill at
                    composing in minor keys.

                <p>
                    If we take a look at the upbeat to the first bar of the B
                    part, we see a B-double flat: the next notes are a chord
                    composed of E-flat and G-flat. But we should note that the
                    relationship between a B-double flat (or an A) and E-flat
                    form a tritone, an extremely dissonant interval— in fact, it
                    is considered the most dissonant along with the minor
                    second, or the half-step. There is no doubt that tritones
                    have been used very often before in music: they take part in
                    the dominant fifth, which is a very common chord. However,
                    the fact that in this sonata, they are being given serious
                    prominence to even take up a melody position is something
                    very groundbreaking and harmonically innovative, as Schiff
                    puts it. So this piece really pushed our musical
                    understanding forward on the possible uses of dissonances,
                    and really reflects the romantic usage of dissonance. This
                    continues on in the actual bar when the C-natural of the
                    left-hand forms a tritone with the G-flat of the right, and
                    goes on in the repetition of the phrase in bar 121 with the
                    G-natural of the bass clashing with the D-flat of the
                    treble. All of this dissonance gives this part great amounts
                    of negative emotion: whether it be pathos or fear is up to
                    the reader to decide. After that, we get a variation on the
                    previous rhythmic pattern, with a 16th note on the 3rd beat
                    contrasted by another sforzando 16th note on the upbeat:
                    this really emphasizes the upbeat and strengthens the
                    syncopations that were already there, making the music feel
                    even more bent. This new rhythm continues on for 6 bars of
                    the transitory passage until we get back to the home key of
                    A-flat, upon which we restate the A part and fade away to
                    nothingness.

                    As I previously mentioned, each variation in this set
                    foreshadows a movement in this sonata. And while the
                    previous variation had authors disagreeing, here essentially
                    all sources that I have seen agree that this foreshadows the
                    3rd movement, which is the namesake funeral march. They have
                    a large number of similarities: the A-flat minor key
                    signature is the most prominent one, but also the liberal
                    use of staccato (often overshadowed by the liberal and
                    justified use of pedal by performers and interpreters), the
                    great block chords in the right hand as the left hand plays
                    countermelodies, even the use of sforzandi and fortissimi
                    closely reflect each other. There is one final thing that
                    both share: a climax that grows louder and louder, reaching
                    its loudest on the dominant before suddenly petering out
                    right then ending on a soft note, in a sense dying out. It’s
                    difficult for me to say exactly when this practice began:
                    Haydn’s Variations in F minor, which many believe had a lot
                    of influence on Beethoven, seems to have a technique like
                    this on a picardy third [a type of chord at the end of a
                    piece where the chord is sharpened, making the last note
                    major rather than minor], and Mozart’s Confutatis in his
                    celebrated Requiem has something similar, but I think it was
                    really Beethoven that began using this technique regularly
                    and often (primarily because classical composers did not
                    write a lot of pieces in minor keys) and his influence
                    propagated the effects of this on essentially all romantic
                    music, most notably with Chopin’s famous
                    <a

                    and Chopin’s own funeral march in his own
                    sonata[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUk3_qTTVg4], that
                    took a lot of inspiration from this one. So all in all, I
                    would say that the effects of this sonata are varied and
                    widespread.

                    This variation is almost wholly different from the variation
                    that preceded it, as the last one was to the variation that
                    preceded it. In fact, this variation shares a lot of
                    characteristics with Variazione II, in that both are light
                    and humorous, rather than serious and grave. The feeling of
                    this variation also heavily depends on the interpreter:
                    Kumar states that when played slowly, it feels more ironic
                    and funny, “like a heavy person trying to dance a ballet”,
                    to use an odd metaphor; when played quickly, it feels like
                    more a scherzo. As always, the choice of which
                    interpretation you prefer is up to the reader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With respect to the music itself, it is much like Variazione
                    I in that it liberally uses the different registers of a
                    piano, in this case in a more light way than the previous
                    variations. While the register-writing for the first
                    variation seems to be well-suited for the string quartet,
                    this register writing seems to fit the woodwind section very
                    well: the clarinet, oboe, and flute seem to be trading off
                    the melody in the right hand, with the timbral differences
                    allowing the syncopations to shine through that are
                    difficult to hear on the piano; the bassoon, french horn,
                    and perhaps the clarinet playing the left-hand
                    countermelody, which also uses the different bass registers
                    to great effect. As always, there are two A parts: the first
                    A part has unison melodies running over a eighth-note bass:
                    the second a part has the melody in octaves running over an
                    interrupted 16th note bass. Lastly, we see the texture shift
                    when moving from the first A part to the second, with the
                    pianist being asked to play legato: so we see that Beethoven
                    could use shifts in texture very well to keep the music from
                    becoming stale.

                    After that, we get the B part, where the first 4 bars are
                    played in the same syncopated staccato manner. After that,
                    the 6 bar transitory passage is played, with a series of
                    syncopated resolutions, with the key chord always falling on
                    the middle beat: I feel as though this part sounds
                    especially jaunty, as the “resolutions” go up and up the
                    keyboard’s register. This variation especially gives us
                    insight into the harmonic structure of the theme: if one
                    were to do a harmonic analysis of this piece (regrettably, I
                    was unable to find one over the internet), this variation
                    might be very useful in determining that. After that, we get
                    a fast bass scale (which also has a slight element of humor,
                    as the bass tones sound very clunky when attempting to play
                    such a light scale so quickly), we repeat the A part with
                    few changes from the second repetition, and then close this
                    penultimate variation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This variation is unlike the previous variation in one last
                    way: while authors all agree that the previous variation
                    most reflects the funeral march, authors disagree on whether
                    this variation reflects the second movement, which is the
                    scherzo that has already been compared to the 2nd variation,
                    or the fourth movement, which is a wonderful rondo. I think
                    the answer to this depends on the interpretation of the
                    player: if this variation is played more slowly and the last
                    movement also played in a graceful and slow-paced way, this
                    might better match the last movement: however, if this
                    variation is played more quickly, it will better match the
                    second movement. Overall, I think that this variation best
                    matches the second movement, in the light of Variazione V
                    which best matches the final movement, but as always, the
                    reader is free to draw their own conclusions.

                <p>
                    And so we come to the last variation. Much as Variazione IV
                    used the same register-writing technique as Variazione I,
                    only applied with a different mood and style, this variation
                    uses the same deconstructionist technique as Variazione II:
                    but this time, rather than the woodwinds that were playing
                    the second variation, this one seems best scored for strings
                    or string and orchestra, as best befits the finale to this
                    set of variations. Indeed, the path of this set of
                    variations is remarked to be elliptical: it goes out and out
                    until it reaches the furthest from the theme, in Variazione
                    III, the goes back closer and closer, reflecting everything
                    that came before. And as the melody in the second variation
                    was placed in the bass, the melody here is hidden in the
                    alto voice: an analysis of the triplets in the first A part
                    shows that it has a constant pattern, with a pedal note
                    followed by a non-chord, embellishing tone (it’s difficult
                    to say whether this is a passing tone or a neighbor tone)
                    and then followed by the actual melody, while the second A
                    part has the melody clearly marked with the second voice.
                    You can see the diagram below to see the melody tones in the
                    first A part, which have been highlighted— they are the
                    exact same as in the first variation.

                <p>
                    There is also another technique used in the first half of
                    this final variation that differentiates the first A part
                    from the second A part: while the first A uses triplet 16th
                    notes, the second speeds up to using 32nd notes, which make
                    it feel like the melody is climaxing or blossoming into
                    something that I find quite beautiful. This part is usually
                    played with a great wash of pedal and wonderful dynamics
                    that only add the the beauty of the piece, and all add to
                    the orchestral coloration of this piece— it really does feel
                    like the whole orchestra is now playing this variation with
                    great emotion and strength. Indeed, these sorts of textures
                    were revisited and brought to fullness by the late Beethoven
                    some 20 years later, in his 30th Sonata, Opus 109: there, we
                    get to see the full progression of the theme in the final
                    movement’s fourth variation, starting from its quarter-note
                    chorale nature and progressing to eighth-notes, eight-note
                    triplets, 16th-notes, 32nd-notes, and then finally reaching
                    its climax at the trill, played as quickly as possible
                    before dying down and restating the chorale theme.

                    When we reach the B part, in order to distinguish it from
                    the previous thickly orchestrated A parts, Beethoven writes
                    more thinly: he first writes the melody in a higher
                    register, which naturally cannot sustain as long as the bass
                    tones on the piano, and then he writes in many rests, which
                    give it a lighter feel compared to the weightiness of the
                    previous part. After those first four bars, we get back to
                    the six bar transitory passage, where he places a running
                    32nd-note counterpoint in the alto voice that outlines the
                    melody quite well, in my opinion, and prepares us for the
                    last restatement of the A part. Unlike previous variations,
                    where this last A part was essentially the same as the
                    second, this one has some key differences: while much of the
                    accompaniment is the same, the melody is switched to the
                    16th note version, meaning that it feels fuller and faster
                    than the second A part. And after that final run, we begin
                    to rest and dial back: the alto voice returns to
                    accompaniment duties, playing 16th-note chords over and over
                    again as the bass plays a countermelody in staccato that
                    Schiff remarks is much like the pizzicato of cellos and
                    double-basses. And as we decrescendo from the climax in the
                    last part, we hear a wonderful (and quite beautiful, if I do
                    say so myself) melody in the soprano: it feels a little bit
                    like a lullaby, slowly softening and softening until we
                    reach the end of the piece, hit the final home chord played
                    pianissimo or extremely softly, and go to sleep, marking the
                    end of this first movement.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    At the time, this sonata was extremely popular: it was one
                    of the only sonatas by Beethoven that today we know have
                    been publicly played for audiences, which was unusual at the
                    time because sonatas were regularly only played for private
                    audiences, as befitted the more intimate understanding of
                    the classicists of the sonata. The funeral march in
                    particular was an instant hit, even going so far as to be
                    played at Beethoven’s funeral. It also inspired many other
                    composers of the time: I have already mentioned Schubert,
                    who was very much an ardent Beethoven fan, but it also
                    inspired Chopin, who was more ambivalent and lukewarm about
                    Beethoven: this A-flat major sonata was reportedly the only
                    one Chopin played at his audiences and salons, and he liked
                    it so much that it served as inspiration for his own 2nd
                    sonata, which is also well-known for the funeral march in
                    its third movement (the perennially popular
                    <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUk3_qTTVg4&t=672s"

                        >Funeral March in B-flat minor</a
                    >, another extremely flat key). And there, we get to see the
                    difference between Chopin and Beethoven: I feel like
                    Beethoven’s funeral march is a lot warmer, because its
                    cadences are strong and loud discounting the last, final
                    cadence, which is somewhat eerie— all the cadences of
                    Chopin, however, are soft, giving all of them the tragic
                    quality that was only afforded to the last cadence in
                    Beethoven’s march. But notwithstanding that, we see that it
                    had a large effect on Beethoven’s contemporaries.

                    Regrettably, it is nowhere as popular now. Joachim Kaiser,
                    an active music critic, notes that it might have been its
                    elegant and sentimental character that made it excellent for
                    the people living budding romantic period in which time
                    Beethoven composed that make it more neglected today, being
                    a victim of oversentimentality: much as the colder
                    Appassionata sonata shines over the warmer Les Adieux, so it
                    is with the colder Moonlight sonata, composed in the same
                    year, over this warmer Funeral March sonata. However, I
                    think it still has its virtues despite being a little
                    oversentimental because it reflects a fonder view of life,
                    one that, while marred by sorrow, still manages to look on
                    the bright side. And that is why I consider it one of
                    Beethoven’s seminal works even up to today. Thank you!
