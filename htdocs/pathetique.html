                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 was composed by Beethoven in 1798 and was 
                    published in the year 1799. It was dedicated to Prince Karl 
                    von Lichnowsky, a good friend and artistic patron of Beethoven.
                    It is unknown whether it was Beethoven or his publishers that 
                    gave it the nickname "Pathétique" (meaning full of emotion or sorrow 
                    or "pathos") but it is known that Beethoven found the name acceptable, 
                    at the very least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in Beethoven's day, this was a very famous and popular sonata:
                    James (2016) states that it was so popular that arrangements for 
                    wind nonet, string quartet and quintet, piano quartet, 
                    theatre orchestra, and other such musical ensembles have been 
                    made throughout the years. It captures emotion in  a way that 
                    few pieces thence did, and seriously propelled the musical zeitgeist 
                    forwards from the Classical Era into the Early Romantic Era. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much as previous sonatas were, the first movement is the most 
                    prominent, being in sonata form and taking the most time of 
                    all the movements. It also contains much of the pathos or emotion 
                    in the whole movement, and is in the key of C minor or 3 flats.
                    The second movement, not discussed for the sake of brevity,
                    is the slow movement in Adagio Cantabile, or 
                    "slowly and in a singing style": it is in the key of A-flat major, with 4 flats. 
                    Lastly, the third movement, also not discussed, is a Rondo, and is in the home key of C minor.
                    I believe this sonata both exemplifies our understanding of traditional, 
                    classical, sonatas, while also displaying Beethoven's style of writing 
                    and thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first movement is quite long compared to most sonatas of 
                    the time, clocking in at 310 measures or around 8 pages in most 
                    editions. As with most other sonatas of the time, this first movement 
                    is in a definite sonata form, albeit we already begin to see 
                    the introduction and the coda that are usually not so much a 
                    part of the textbook form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was published by 
                    Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an urtext edition, so while the author 
                    believes it is legal here in the Philippines, I am not so sure 
                    about the situations in other countries. The same applies for 
                    the recordings which I have duly cut up into the component parts: 
                    These were made by Fritz Jank in 1962.

                <p>
                    The sonata begins with a huge C-minor chord, with all hands playing 
                    some seven notes: even from the beginning, the piece evokes grandeur and sorrow, 
                    like few others before. James states that this chord would have shaken many 
                    fortepianos to their cores in Beethoven's day with their sheer weight. After this, 
                    the melody suddenly softens and goes up 2 steps, repeats the uppermost note, 
                    and then goes down 1 step. This rising-falling motif is important: 
                    it reappears later on, both in the introduction and also in the 
                    development, some 100 bars away. 
                    The constant recurrence of this motif is the reason why Andras Schiff 
                    states that this part is no mere introduction, but instead constitutes 
                    the first theme in the exposition: whether you agree or disagree 
                    with this view is up to you, but it will have effects later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before we go on to the rest of the bars, we should take note of 2 things. 
                    First, the tempo is not Allegro, as was common with most first movements of 
                    the time, but instead is Grave. These tempi lie on the opposite ends of 
                    the spectrum of speeds: while Allegro means "lively" upon being translated 
                    from Italian, and is related to words like "alacrity", you don't have to know 
                    Italian to understand that Grave means playing gravely, slowly, and solemnly. 
                    This tempo difference, especially compared to the material 10 measures on, 
                    is why most consider this part just to be an introduction: for example, 
                    another introduction like this lies with the Les Adieux Sonata, which I 
                    discuss elsewhere. Second, the dynamic marking is highly unusual: 
                    fp, or forte-piano, means to play loudly and then suddenly softly. 
                    However, this effect is impossible on the piano: a note will decay for 
                    however long you hold the note and will disappear upon releasing the note, 
                    meaning that there is no way to play the same note softly. Of course, 
                    skilled players like Schiff have found a workaround, by repeating the 
                    note softly while releasing the pedal holding the loud note (albeit I 
                    am not entirely sure if this is correct, because I unfortunately did not 
                    see the lecture with my own eyes)– but, even so, it is somewhat unusual 
                    and unpianistic. This often leads people to say it feels more like a 
                    piano reduction of a symphony or a reduction of a piano concerto rather 
                    than a piano sonata— which may be the reason why it has been arranged 
                    for other instruments so many times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on, we see that the forte-piano chords and the rising-falling motif 
                    are repeated in the second measure, but this time moved up— the same occurs 
                    with the third bar, with the motif repeated twice. Each time the forte-piano 
                    chord recurs, it becomes more and more dissonant, liberally using 
                    <span title="an extremely dissonant interval">tritones</span> to evoke the 
                    gut-wrenching characteristic of this part, until it reaches the end of 4th 
                    measure and calms slightly with a scalar passage reminiscent of the Fantasias 
                    of Bach.

                <p>
                    We now move on to the 4th to 10th measures. 
                    We can view it as something of a drama between 2 characters: 
                    the first has a pleading, softer voice, while the second 
                    has a voice of refusal, anger, and strength. 
                    This is reflected by the usage of different registers and dynamics of the piano. 
                    The angrier voice has a range somewhere between middle C and high C, 
                    which is close to the range of a tenor, albeit the lowest notes 
                    approach the bass range. It also always plays at a fortissimo dynamic, 
                    which means to play very loudly. On the other hand, the pleading voice 
                    has a range from high C to the C the octave above that, which approximates 
                    the range of a soprano. It also plays piano, or softly. 
                    So I think this is a fair representation of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the music, both use the same melodic idea, the rising-falling motif: 
                    this idea occurs both in the higher register and in the lower register, 
                    but slightly altered and with the harmonies filled in. On the left hand, 
                    we have a chromatically descending bass: while the bass is usually punctuated 
                    by the fortissimo chords, which obscure the descent somewhat, it is very clear 
                    from bars 7 to 8, when it constantly descends as it is counterbalanced by the 
                    ascending right hand until the melody peaks at bar 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In bars 9 and 10, the music thins significantly, with many dramatic pauses: 
                    the left hand comes down octave by octave and pulls the right hand down with it. 
                    In the second half of measure 10, we get a soft chromatic scale running down 2 octaves 
                    (this scale is not supposed to be showy nor virtuosic, but rather deflationary, 
                    according to James) until we reach the A flat, and proceed to resolve to the Allegro.
                    Note that the transition between the 2 parts is sudden, without pause: contrast 
                    is one of the hallmarks of a Beethoven Sonata, and here the contrast would be 
                    between tempos, as elsewhere it may be with the dynamics.

                <h3>Exposition</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The allegro begins with the first theme, what is referred to as a "Mannheim Rocket": 
                    a huge, ascending, arpeggio continuously going upwards and upwards until it reaches 
                    its peak 2 octaves later. This technique features prominently in the Mannheim school of 
                    composition: a notable example would be with the finale of Mozart's 40th Symphony. 
                    However, while the natural tendency would be to crescendo over the upward run, 
                    Beethoven instructs the performer to play softly– this evokes the feeling of 
                    tension rather than a violent outburst, albeit those will invariably come later. 
                    After running up for some 4 bars, it begins to sink back down, loudening more and more 
                    until the repetition of the phrase. This 8-bar phrase composes the first theme of the 
                    sonata, and we will be playing around with it more a little bit later. For convenience, 
                    I will call this Theme 1.1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, I think it's somewhat important for me to mention the left hand: it is playing notes 
                    with a tremolo effect, rapidly moving from one note to the other. This is yet another 
                    unpianistic effect in this sonata: tremolos are very easy to do on the violin, viola, cello, 
                    and other string instruments (and are considered basic techniques on those instruments), 
                    but are significantly more difficult on the piano, where effort is required to develop a 
                    tremolo that is soft, smooth, and musical.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We now move on to the next few bars. Here, we have sforzando octaves over a piano 
                    accompaniment, giving it the quality of a declaration or a flash of thunder, before 
                    the right hand tumbles down in a virtuosic arpeggio. This is repeated twice before 
                    we begin to transition to the next part of the exposition using the first theme, stated above. 
                    Some sources state that this part constitutes a second "first theme" or perhaps a 
                    "subsidiary theme", while others state that this is just a connecting passage: 
                    I am more inclined to believe that it is not a theme, but rather a connecting passage, 
                    but each person can come away from this piece with a very different conclusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, we have yet more recurrences of theme 1.1, sightly 
                    modified, this time without the descending tail: instead, it ascends 
                    higher and higher, pulled down by sforzando chords 
                    every 4 bars. Given that the second theme ends in G minor, 
                    the dominant of C, we have a rise in G major from bars 35 to 37, 
                    a rise in A-flat major from bars 39 to 41, and 
                    a rise in B-flat major from bars 43 to 45, readying for 
                    a possible second theme in E-flat major.
                </p>

                    Nope! It turns out the second theme is instead in E-flat minor, 
                    which, while sharing the same root as E-flat major or being "parallel" to it, 
                    is different— it still sounds sad, especially when compared to the next few parts. 
                    This harmonic surprise, no matter how small, reveals 2 things that will recur 
                    in Beethoven's works: the first would be the quick switch between the major 
                    and the parallel minor, and the second would be the harmonic surprises that 
                    constantly recur in his works and capture the attention of the listener. 
                    For convenience, I will refer to this theme as theme 2.1: the first theme 
                    of the second theme group.

                    With regards to the music itself, it is also more orchestral than pianistic: 
                    this is obviated by the constant hand-crossings in the right hand, which is 
                    evidenced by the (also constant) clef changes. This gives it the effect of 
                    a duet, with a bass voice around low C or in the octave above C3 and a 
                    soprano voice around high C or in the octave above C5. Furthermore, the 
                    soprano voice is heavily ornamented, with sforzando accents and grace notes 
                    embellishing the highest note in the upward arpeggio and mordents ornamenting 
                    the downward staccato runs. This, combined with the held note-chord-chord-chord 
                    accompaniment and the instruction to play softly give it a more light and elegant 
                    quality in the hands of a skillful pianist. I think this is the right time to 
                    mention the fact that the instruction "sforzando" means different things in 
                    different contexts: in a forte context, it can mean to play fortississimo, but 
                    in a piano context, it can mean just playing mezzo-piano or just with an accent, 
                    a sentiment also echoed by Schiff. So I believe this is a good place to have softer 
                    sforzandos as compared to the previous themes.

                    From bars 51 to 62, we stay in the tonality of an E-flat minor, doing either 
                    sforzandos or mordents. In bar 63, we begin to move to D-flat major and restate 
                    the second theme. After that, in bar 75, we remove the sforzandi in the soprano 
                    (moving them instead to the base) and use the mordent tail of the theme to 
                    modulate through to E-flat minor, F minor, C minor, B-flat major, and then 
                    back to E-flat major, according to James.

                    Here, we have another theme, this time in E-flat major, which is the relative 
                    major of C-major (so called because it has the same number of flats and sharps 
                    as the minor). Of course, sources disagree whether this is a third theme or 
                    part of the second theme group— but for convenience, I'll just mark this as theme 
                    2.2, the second theme of the second theme group. Editors of Wikipedia state that 
                    this theme is very much like an <span title="[a bass which has a low note, then 
                    a high note, then a middle note, then a high note, repeated over and over again]">
                    Alberti bass.</span> It begins at the home tone of E-flat major with the bass 
                    figures in the inner voices, and stays mostly still for some 4 bars: it then 
                    moves up quarter-note by quarter-note with the right hand and left hand moving 
                    in contrary motion, crescendoing until it reaches the e-flat an octave up. After 
                    this, we get 2 forte broken chords, much like an orchestral tutti, representing 
                    an IV-V-I cadence (a type of cadence that begins on the 4th scale degree, 
                    goes to the 5th or the dominant, and back to the 1st or the tonic: this is 
                    a very common cadence), bringing us back down for the pattern to be repeated 
                    or leading to the next part.

                <p>
                    We now reach a large, virtuosic run down from the double-high E-flat 
                    to the G in the middle range. Unlike theme 1.2, this does not use 
                    arpeggios to reach downwards but instead uses scales, which prolongs 
                    the descent for much longer: and on the left hand, we have an I-vi-IV-V
                    chord progression, a common chordal system not only in classical music 
                    but also in pop music as is explained by Longdon (2019). However, 
                    in Beethoven's hands, we also get some variation, as in the repeat of 
                    this part the chords change from the held note-chord pattern to an 
                    octave-chord pattern, in ever-more descending ranges. Musicians argue 
                    whether this theme is cadential, meaning its only function is to end 
                    the piece, or whether it is theme 2.3: I'll just side with Kumar (2017), 
                    as previously, on this topic and call it the cadential theme. After that, 
                    we repeat theme 1.1 in the key of E-flat, as with theme 2.2, and go to the 
                    repeat (which I have omitted from the discussion, for the sake of brevity).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But now, the question asked previously comes into play: Is the Grave an 
                    introduction, or is it part of the exposition? If you believe that the 
                    Grave is only part of the introduction, the repeat will only go back to 
                    the Allegro, which would be the top of the exposition. The first edition 
                    agrees with this view, placing the repeat sign at the tempo marking, 
                    and this is the view predominantly taken by most pianists. However, 
                    if you believe that the Grave is part of the exposition, you would 
                    instead repeat back to the top of the entire piece, essentially 
                    lengthening the first movement to dwarf the other 2 movements. 
                    This makes the size of the first movement comparable to the size of 
                    the second and third combined, and is the view taken by such pianists 
                    as Andras Schiff (who is a primary source for this essay) and by Rudolf 
                    Serkin. But regardless of your opinion on this matter, you would then repeat 
                    through all the previous sections and go back here, and then proceed to the 
                    beginning of the development.

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As previously stated, the development is when we begin to play around with the 
                    themes, earlier presented, in different harmonies and key colors. As a short 
                    review, there are five themes: the introductory theme, theme 1.1, 
                    theme 2.1, theme 2.2, and the cadential theme.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The development, interestingly, does not begin straight away with the 
                    themes but instead goes back to the Grave and restates the fortepiano chords. 
                    This restatement of the introduction, along with the restatement later on close 
                    to the Coda, is unique to this piece— James states that this reminds us of the 
                    aggrieved context to which the Allegro is a response. In any case, it begins 
                    in G minor in bar 133 and it moves up to E-flat in the next: but instead of 
                    moving up again in bar 135, it stays on E-flat and uses its 
                    <span title="[meaning same note: E-flat and D-sharp are the same note]">enharmonic</span> 
                    quality to D-sharp to move to E minor. This usage of enharmonic notes is by no 
                    means unique to this piece: a similar occurrence happens with the Appassionata 
                    Sonata, which is studied in depth in the dissertation thesis of Reale (2019).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before continuing, I believe we ought to note the fact that we have moved 
                    to E minor, a key with 1 sharp, from C minor, a key with 3 flats: these 2 keys 
                    are very far away from each other, and so this is a real harmonic surprise. 
                    Beethoven's ability to bring us to keys very far away from the home key and 
                    back in a very natural way is something that recurs in all of his sonatas, 
                    not just this one: I will try to point out this unique occurrence whenever we 
                    see it. But onwards we go, to the development!

                <p>
                    We begin with Theme 1.1, the Mannheim Rocket, in the key of E minor— the 
                    same key that we modulated to in the introductory passage earlier. 
                    However, this time, it is accompanied by a great crescendo, which gives 
                    it a more agitated and explosive character than the more restrained 
                    versions we have heard earlier. After this, we have the introductory 
                    rising-falling theme, also in E minor, played piano or softly. James 
                    remarks that this gives us the 2 views of suffering: there is the 
                    agitated, fighting side, and the depressed, suffering side of pathos— 
                    a wild swing that the sonata reflects with its themes. The combination 
                    of these motives is repeated, this time in the key of D major, which 
                    gives it a slightly more desperate feeling as it sinks lower.

                <p>
                    We now continue with the roles of the hands reversed: this time, the 
                    left hand is playing a reduced version of Theme 1.1, without the tail 
                    and without the lower voice, as the right hand plays the tremolos that 
                    used to be in the bass. Even as the left hand tries to go up and up and up, 
                    the music overall chromatically descends: each motif is that of a 
                    descending semitone, and the tremolos descend every 4 bars from B-flat 
                    to A and then to A-flat. After 12 bars of this relative stability, the 
                    tremolos begin to fall and fall from the G in the middle register down 
                    to the B of the double-low register, nearly 2 octaves in span. As with 
                    many of the developments of Beethoven in minor keys, this passage is very 
                    unstable and very chromatic, with unclear harmonies wafting in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe this is now a good time to take a closer look at Theme 1.1, 
                    and the reduction of it given here. The reduction here only has the top 
                    notes of the theme, and we can see that it descends by a semitone every 
                    2 notes: if we look back at the modified statement of Theme 1.1 that was 
                    used to connect to Theme 2.1, we see that it is always composed of a 
                    descending semitone somewhere in the chord: this is not wholly audible, 
                    however, because there is always an ascending semitone as well, and the 
                    lower and upper voice trade-off these parts. When it is isolated and 
                    purified, as here, we see that it is built off a device that James 
                    states is used to convey weeping or suffering. However, I would remark 
                    that while it may convey a more doleful air when slowed down, I believe 
                    that when sped up to be this fast, it gives a feeling more of thinned 
                    anger and small, pinpoint bursts that do nothing to abate it rather than of sorrow.

                <p>
                    Now, if we look at the sheet music, we're only around halfway through the 
                    development: 5 lines have passed, and there are still 5 lines left to go. 
                    But in reality, we have reached the dominant: if you can read the first 
                    note of the tremolo, it is clear that the note is G, which is the dominant 
                    of C. It is also in a tremolo in the left hand, which makes it a tremolo 
                    drone, which gives it a similar status to that of an organ-point, of a 
                    long held-note in the left hand. In the classical period, this would 
                    signal the end of the development: for example, in Mozart's A minor 
                    piano sonata, K. 310, the dominant stays only for 6 measures before 
                    resolving back to the recapitulation. Indeed, one of Beethoven's hallmarks 
                    would have been his ability to extend the dominant tone for very long 
                    periods of time, and it is a pattern that we will see later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the music itself, we see that it is composed of two 
                    four-bar phrases. The first has low arpeggios, very close to the 
                    tremolos in the left hand, played at a pianissimo level or very 
                    quietly. These arpeggios are very unstable, and they move 
                    chromatically up and down, unable to decide which chord to strike: 
                    if we identify pathos, as suffering and rage, this is certainly on the 
                    suffering, depressed, wavering side. The second phrase has a modified,
                    2-bar form of Theme 1.1 shoot upwards from middle E to double-high E: 
                    unlike the modified forms of theme 1.1 as we have seen them earlier, 
                    though, this form has a descending tail, in this case composed of a 
                    trill. Here, the trill is used more in a classical sense, of being 
                    used to resolve back to the G: however, in later sonatas, Beethoven 
                    would use the trill in more unique and unusual ways, especially in his 
                    late-period sonatas with the Hammerklavier. This form of the Mannheim 
                    rocket is accompanied by a crescendo all the way up to the loud 
                    sforzando at the top of the phrase, which gives it the angered 
                    nature of pathos. These 2 phrases are repeated twice before Beethoven 
                    focuses on the trilled ending and uses a huge downward scale, reminiscent 
                    of the cadential theme, to reach the C in the very lowest register 
                    of the old fortepianos. And thus, we move to the recapitulation!

                <p>
                    Now, something that may not have been obvious when I introduced 
                    Sonata Form on the landing page would be the fact that it is 
                    not only the second theme but also the first theme that changes. 
                    The recapitulation is not just a restatement of the theme, 
                    especially not in Beethoven’s time when thematic development was king: 
                    instead, we see how the Development section, how the battle between 
                    little fragments of the theme and big fragments of the theme in all 
                    different keys affects the motifs when they come out of the blender. 
                    In this case, I think the entire recapitulation is now dripped and 
                    soaked in the pathos that permeated the development: every theme 
                    is now in a minor key, all dripped with the sorrow and anguish 
                    expressed in the development. And so, we begin with the first theme.

                <p>
                    In this case, Theme 1.1 is repeated twice, without any changes to 
                    its structure in the first repetition. However, in the second repetition, 
                    we get an entirely different tail of the theme: instead of remaining in 
                    C minor, as the head does, it modulates to D flat major on the first fall, 
                    E flat minor on the second fall, and then finally to F minor on the 
                    third fall, when it prepares to move on to the next theme. Now, there 
                    are 2 things to note here: the first would be that the passage of a 
                    sudden sforzando chord with a falling arpeggio that occurred in the 
                    exposition has disappeared, which is a significant indicator that it 
                    is not a theme but rather just a passage or at best a “subsidiary theme”, 
                    as per James. The other thing to note is the way the first theme 
                    transitions to the second: while in the exposition, we used the 
                    head of the theme to transition, going from G to A-flat to B-flat, 
                    we now use the tail of the theme to transition from C to D-flat to 
                    E-flat, which gives us a very pleasing symmetry: both have rising 
                    roots, but the exact way these are expressed changes. Indeed, music 
                    analysis gives us insight into the hidden workings of a piece in 
                    ways that are difficult to determine on the first pass. Regardless, 
                    we now move on:

                <p>
                    We now have the second theme. But wait— it’s not in C minor, but 
                    instead it’s in F minor! This is a smaller harmonic surprise, 
                    albeit F minor and C minor are far more related (F is the subdominant
                    of C) rather than the E flat major and C minor of previously. And 
                    indeed, after the first statement of Theme 2.1 in F minor over bars 
                    221 to 229, it begins modulating to C minor over bars 229 to 232 and 
                    settles the second half of the theme in bar 233, or the second line, 
                    6th bar from the right. It now stays in C minor, the expected key, until 
                    bar 245 when uses the mordent tail of the second theme to modulate to F, 
                    and then to B flat, then E flat, then A flat, then takes advantage of 
                    the neighboring tone to move right back to G— preparing us for Theme 2.2, 
                    in the key of C-minor.

                <p>
                    Theme 2.2 is slightly unusual in that it is not just a direct transposition 
                    of the theme into the key of C minor: instead, while the beginning and 
                    end are changed to align more with the minor tonality, the middle itself 
                    is directly copied from the first statement in the exposition. If we look 
                    at the first 4 bars when the theme is stable, both the right hand and the 
                    left hand move away from the C-minor Alberti bass and pull outwards: thus, 
                    when the contrary motion begins in bar 257 or in the first line, 5th bar, 
                    we see that the right hand jumps to e natural and the left hand goes up 
                    rather than down to b-flat to mimic more the statement of the theme in 
                    the exposition. This makes it significantly more interesting as compared 
                    to a direct transposition, which I feel sounds fairly bland with the 
                    repeated C-minor chords. Furthermore, instead of changing on the second 
                    repeat of this theme, it instead repeats it perfectly: maybe this is 
                    already because it was good enough to transition to the next material, 
                    which is also in C minor. With respect to the music itself, instead 
                    of the glorious and hopeful feeling that was evoked with the E-flat 
                    major phrase earlier (E-flat major is often associated with heroic 
                    music, like Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture or Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony), 
                    we get an anticipatory phrase, threatening the possibility of danger with 
                    the minor melody humming over a minor background: a danger that closens 
                    with every note.

                    We now move on to the cadential theme, which is also in C minor: its light 
                    and airy quality are still present, but now tinged with the pathos that 
                    permeates the recapitulation. After it tumbles down from the double-high 
                    C to the middle E-flat twice, we get a repetition of Theme 1.1, this 
                    time with the player shouting at forte, until we reach 2 fortissimo 
                    diminished seventh chords— a type of chord, built on the seventh 
                    scale degree (e.g. in the key of C major, the note is B), that has a 
                    lot of dissonance because of the tritone that serves as its building block. 
                    Both of those chords signal the end of the recapitulation and the beginning of the coda.

                    For the third or fourth time, depending on whether you repeated the 
                    Grave as stated above, we have another slow passage. But instead of 
                    being punctuated by the forte-piano chords which signal the tonality 
                    of the motif, we get dead silence: an extraordinarily dramatic silence, 
                    in any case. Gone now are the dissonant shouts and refusals, and what 
                    is left is the soft, suffocated, depressed rising-falling motif. This 
                    now begins by using the material in the third bar of the introduction, 
                    of a cadence from F sharp, diminished seventh, to G-minor. Then we 
                    move up by a fourth to another rising falling passage, moving from B, 
                    diminished seventh, to C minor. Lastly, we get another diminished 
                    seventh chord, but the phrase stops before it is able to resolve and 
                    instead sinks down and down and down until it reaches the double-low 
                    octave and moves without pause to the ending.

                <p>
                    After the Grave, we get one last recurrence of the theme in its original 
                    form: starting from a soft piano, it ascends as softly as it did in the 
                    exposition. But instead of descending, as with the exposition, it stays 
                    up and crescendos to fortissimo with the bass descending chromatically. 
                    And thus the movement is finished: with 5 fortissimo block chords, shaking 
                    the fortepiano of Beethoven’s day and even some modern pianos, and 
                    concluding with the final, perfect v-i cadence.

                <h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>
                <p>
                    Even this early in Beethoven’s music, we already begin to see the hallmarks 
                    of his playing: an extended development and coda, extended dominant preparation, 
                    stark contrasts between the loud and soft, the ability to modulate from nearby 
                    keys to far away and then back home, and the motivic economy. Each of these facets 
                    plays a greater and greater role as Beethoven matures and enters his middle and
                    late periods: each will be transformed in new ways as he produces monumental work 
                    after monumental work. But even so, I believe it is a worthwhile endeavor to 
                    study the young Beethoven so that when we see his middle and late works, we will 
                    have the context to be able to say whether it is new, or whether it is a 
                    developed form of something that appeared earlier on. Thank you for reading!
