                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 was composed by Beethoven in 1798 and was 
                    published in the year 1799. It was dedicated to Prince Karl 
                    von Lichnowsky, a good friend and artistic patron of Beethoven.
                    It is unknown whether it was Beethoven or his publishers that 
                    gave it the nickname "Pathétique" (meaning full of emotion or sorrow 
                    or "pathos") but it is known that Beethoven found the name acceptable, 
                    at the very least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in Beethoven's day, this was a very famous and popular sonata:
                    James (2016) states that it was so popular that arrangements for 
                    wind nonet, string quartet and quintet, piano quartet, 
                    theatre orchestra, and other such musical ensembles have been 
                    made throughout the years. It captures emotion in  a way that 
                    few pieces thence did, and seriously propelled the musical zeitgeist 
                    forwards from the Classical Era into the Early Romantic Era. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much as previous sonatas were, the first movement is the most 
                    prominent, being in sonata form and taking the most time of 
                    all the movements. It also contains much of the pathos or emotion 
                    in the whole movement, and is in the key of C minor or 3 flats.
                    The second movement, not discussed for the sake of brevity,
                    is the slow movement in Adagio Cantabile, or 
                    "slowly and in a singing style": it is in the key of A-flat major, with 4 flats. 
                    Lastly, the third movement, also not discussed, is a Rondo, and is in the home key of C minor.
                    I believe this sonata both exemplifies our understanding of traditional, 
                    classical, sonatas, while also displaying Beethoven's style of writing 
                    and thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first movement is quite long compared to most sonatas of 
                    the time, clocking in at 310 measures or around 8 pages in most 
                    editions. As with most other sonatas of the time, this first movement 
                    is in a definite sonata form, albeit we already begin to see 
                    the introduction and the coda that are usually not so much a 
                    part of the textbook form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was published by 
                    Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an urtext edition, so while the author 
                    believes it is legal here in the Philippines, I am not so sure 
                    about the situations in other countries. The same applies for 
                    the recordings which I have duly cut up into the component parts: 
                    These were made by Fritz Jank in 1962.

                <p>
                    The sonata begins with a huge C-minor chord, with all hands playing 
                    some seven notes: even from the beginning, the piece evokes grandeur and sorrow, 
                    like few others before. James states that this chord would have shaken many 
                    fortepianos to their cores in Beethoven's day with their sheer weight. After this, 
                    the melody suddenly softens and goes up 2 steps, repeats the uppermost note, 
                    and then goes down 1 step. This rising-falling motif is important: 
                    it reappears later on, both in the introduction and also in the 
                    development, some 100 bars away. 
                    The constant recurrence of this motif is the reason why Andras Schiff 
                    states that this part is no mere introduction, but instead constitutes 
                    the first theme in the exposition: whether you agree or disagree 
                    with this view is up to you, but it will have effects later on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before we go on to the rest of the bars, we should take note of 2 things. 
                    First, the tempo is not Allegro, as was common with most first movements of 
                    the time, but instead is Grave. These tempi lie on the opposite ends of 
                    the spectrum of speeds: while Allegro means "lively" upon being translated 
                    from Italian, and is related to words like "alacrity", you don't have to know 
                    Italian to understand that Grave means playing gravely, slowly, and solemnly. 
                    This tempo difference, especially compared to the material 10 measures on, 
                    is why most consider this part just to be an introduction: for example, 
                    another introduction like this lies with the Les Adieux Sonata, which I 
                    discuss elsewhere. Second, the dynamic marking is highly unusual: 
                    fp, or forte-piano, means to play loudly and then suddenly softly. 
                    However, this effect is impossible on the piano: a note will decay for 
                    however long you hold the note and will disappear upon releasing the note, 
                    meaning that there is no way to play the same note softly. Of course, 
                    skilled players like Schiff have found a workaround, by repeating the 
                    note softly while releasing the pedal holding the loud note (albeit I 
                    am not entirely sure if this is correct, because I unfortunately did not 
                    see the lecture with my own eyes)– but, even so, it is somewhat unusual 
                    and unpianistic. This often leads people to say it feels more like a 
                    piano reduction of a symphony or a reduction of a piano concerto rather 
                    than a piano sonata— which may be the reason why it has been arranged 
                    for other instruments so many times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on, we see that the forte-piano chords and the rising-falling motif 
                    are repeated in the second measure, but this time moved up— the same occurs 
                    with the third bar, with the motif repeated twice. Each time the forte-piano 
                    chord recurs, it becomes more and more dissonant, liberally using 
                    <span title="an extremely dissonant interval" class="underscore">tritones</span> to evoke the 
                    gut-wrenching characteristic of this part, until it reaches the end of 4th 
                    measure and calms slightly with a scalar passage reminiscent of the Fantasias 
                    of Bach.

                <p>
                    We now move on to the 4th to 10th measures. 
                    We can view it as something of a drama between 2 characters: 
                    the first has a pleading, softer voice, while the second 
                    has a voice of refusal, anger, and strength. 
                    This is reflected by the usage of different registers and dynamics of the piano. 
                    The angrier voice has a range somewhere between middle C and high C, 
                    which is close to the range of a tenor, albeit the lowest notes 
                    approach the bass range. It also always plays at a fortissimo dynamic, 
                    which means to play very loudly. On the other hand, the pleading voice 
                    has a range from high C to the C the octave above that, which approximates 
                    the range of a soprano. It also plays piano, or softly. 
                    So I think this is a fair representation of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With regards to the music, both use the same melodic idea, the rising-falling motif: 
                    this idea occurs both in the higher register and in the lower register, 
                    but slightly altered and with the harmonies filled in. On the left hand, 
                    we have a chromatically descending bass: while the bass is usually punctuated 
                    by the fortissimo chords, which obscure the descent somewhat, it is very clear 
                    from bars 7 to 8, when it constantly descends as it is counterbalanced by the 
                    ascending right hand until the melody peaks at bar 9.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In bars 9 and 10, the music thins significantly, with many dramatic pauses: 
                    the left hand comes down octave by octave and pulls the right hand down with it. 
                    In the second half of measure 10, we get a soft chromatic scale running down 2 octaves 
                    (this scale is not supposed to be showy nor virtuosic, but rather deflationary, 
                    according to James) until we reach the A flat, and proceed to resolve to the Allegro.
                    Note that the transition between the 2 parts is sudden, without pause: contrast 
                    is one of the hallmarks of a Beethoven Sonata, and here the contrast would be 
                    between tempos, as elsewhere it may be with the dynamics.
                </p>
