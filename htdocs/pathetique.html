                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 was composed by Beethoven in 1798 and was 
                    published in the year 1799. It was dedicated to Prince Karl 
                    von Lichnowsky, a good friend and artistic patron of Beethoven.
                    It is unknown whether it was Beethoven or his publishers that 
                    gave it the nickname "Pathétique" (meaning full of emotion or sorrow 
                    or "pathos") but it is known that Beethoven found the name acceptable, 
                    at the very least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in Beethoven's day, this was a very famous and popular sonata:
                    James (2016) states that it was so popular that arrangements for 
                    wind nonet, string quartet and quintet, piano quartet, 
                    theatre orchestra, and other such musical ensembles have been 
                    made throughout the years. It captures emotion in  a way that 
                    few pieces thence did, and seriously propelled the musical zeitgeist 
                    forwards from the Classical Era into the Early Romantic Era. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much as previous sonatas were, the first movement is the most 
                    prominent, being in sonata form and taking the most time of 
                    all the movements. It also contains much of the pathos or emotion 
                    in the whole movement, and is in the key of C minor or 3 flats.
                    The second movement, not discussed for the sake of brevity,
                    is the slow movement in Adagio Cantabile, or 
                    "slowly and in a singing style": it is in the key of A-flat major, with 4 flats. 
                    Lastly, the third movement, also not discussed, is a Rondo, and is in the home key of C minor.
                    I believe this sonata both exemplifies our understanding of traditional, 
                    classical, sonatas, while also displaying Beethoven's style of writing 
                    and thinking.

                    The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was published by 
                    Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an urtext edition, so while the author 
                    believes it is legal here in the Philippines, I am not so sure 
                    about the situations in other countries. The same applies for 
                    the recordings which I have duly cut up into the component parts: 
                    These were made by Fritz Jank in 1962.

                <h2>1st Movement</h2>
                <p>
                    The first movement is quite long compared to most sonatas of 
                    the time, clocking in at 310 measures or around 8 pages in most 
                    editions. As with most other sonatas of the time, this first movement 
                    is in a definite sonata form, albeit we already begin to see 
                    the introduction and the coda that are usually not so much a 
                    part of the textbook form.

                    The piece begins with a huge, C-minor chord, with all hands playing 
                    some seven notes: even from the beginning, the music evokes grandeur 
                    and sorrow.
