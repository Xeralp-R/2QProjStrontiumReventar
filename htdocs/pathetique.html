                    <p>
                        The Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 was composed by Beethoven in
                        1798 and was published in the year 1799. It was
                        dedicated to Prince Karl von Lichnowsky, a good friend
                        and artistic patron of Beethoven. It is unknown whether
                        it was Beethoven or his publishers that gave it the
                        nickname "Pathétique" (meaning full of emotion or sorrow
                        or "pathos") but it is known that Beethoven found the
                        name acceptable, at the very least.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even in Beethoven's day, this was a very famous and
                        popular sonata: James (2016) states that it was so
                        popular that arrangements for wind nonet, string quartet
                        and quintet, piano quartet, theatre orchestra, and other
                        such musical ensembles have been made throughout the
                        years. It captures emotion in a way that few pieces
                        thence did, and seriously propelled the musical
                        zeitgeist forwards from the Classical Era into the Early
                        Romantic Era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much as previous sonatas were, the first movement is the
                        most prominent, being in sonata form and taking the most
                        time of all the movements. It also contains much of the
                        pathos or emotion in the whole movement, and is in the
                        key of C minor or 3 flats. The second movement, not
                        discussed for the sake of brevity, is the slow movement
                        in Adagio Cantabile, or "slowly and in a singing style":
                        it is in the key of A-flat major, with 4 flats. Lastly,
                        the third movement, also not discussed, is a Rondo, and
                        is in the home key of C minor. I believe this sonata
                        both exemplifies our understanding of traditional,
                        classical, sonatas, while also displaying Beethoven's
                        style of writing and thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first movement is quite long compared to most
                        sonatas of the time, clocking in at 310 measures or
                        around 8 pages in most editions. As with most other
                        sonatas of the time, this first movement is in a
                        definite sonata form, albeit we already begin to see the
                        introduction and the coda that are usually not so much a
                        part of the textbook form.
                    </p>

                        The score was taken from the Wallner Edition, which was
                        published by Henle Verlag in 1976. That edition is an
                        urtext edition, so while I believe it is legal here in
                        the Philippines, I am not so sure about the situations
                        in other countries. The same applies for the recordings
                        which I have duly cut up into the component parts: These
                        were made by Fritz Jank in 1962. All of these resources

                        The sonata begins with a huge C-minor chord, with all
                        hands playing some seven notes: even from the beginning,
                        the piece evokes grandeur and sorrow, like few others
                        before. James states that this chord would have shaken
                        many fortepianos to their cores in Beethoven's day with
                        their sheer weight. After this, the melody suddenly
                        softens and goes up 2 steps, repeats the uppermost note,
                        and then goes down 1 step. This rising-falling motif is
                        important: it reappears later on, both in the
                        introduction and also in the development, some 100 bars
                        away. The constant recurrence of this motif is the
                        reason why Andras Schiff states that this part is no
                        mere introduction, but instead constitutes the first
                        theme in the exposition: whether you agree or disagree
                        with this view is up to you, but it will have effects
                        later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, before we go on to the rest of the bars, we should
                        take note of 2 things. First, the tempo is not Allegro,
                        as was common with most first movements of the time, but
                        instead is Grave. These tempi lie on the opposite ends
                        of the spectrum of speeds: while Allegro means "lively"
                        upon being translated from Italian, and is related to
                        words like "alacrity", you don't have to know Italian to
                        understand that Grave means playing gravely, slowly, and
                        solemnly. This tempo difference, especially compared to
                        the material 10 measures on, is why most consider this
                        part just to be an introduction: for example, another
                        introduction like this lies with the Les Adieux Sonata,
                        which I discuss elsewhere. Second, the dynamic marking
                        is highly unusual: fp, or forte-piano, means to play
                        loudly and then suddenly softly. However, this effect is
                        impossible on the piano: a note will decay for however
                        long you hold the note and will disappear upon releasing
                        the note, meaning that there is no way to play the same
                        note softly. Of course, skilled players like Schiff have
                        found a workaround, by repeating the note softly while
                        releasing the pedal holding the loud note (albeit I am
                        not entirely sure if this is correct, because I
                        unfortunately did not see the lecture with my own eyes)–
                        but, even so, it is somewhat unusual and unpianistic.
                        This often leads people to say it feels more like a
                        piano reduction of a symphony or a reduction of a piano
                        concerto rather than a piano sonata— which may be the
                        reason why it has been arranged for other instruments so
                        many times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving on, we see that the forte-piano chords and the
                        rising-falling motif are repeated in the second measure,
                        but this time moved up— the same occurs with the third
                        bar, with the motif repeated twice. Each time the
                        forte-piano chord recurs, it becomes more and more
                        dissonant, liberally using
                        <span title="an extremely dissonant interval"
                            >tritones</span
                        >
                        to evoke the gut-wrenching characteristic of this part,
                        until it reaches the end of 4th measure and calms
                        slightly with a scalar passage reminiscent of the
                        Fantasias of Bach.

                    <p>
                        We now move on to the 4th to 10th measures. We can view
                        it as something of a drama between 2 characters: the
                        first has a pleading, softer voice, while the second has
                        a voice of refusal, anger, and strength. This is
                        reflected by the usage of different registers and
                        dynamics of the piano. The angrier voice has a range
                        somewhere between middle C and high C, which is close to
                        the range of a tenor, albeit the lowest notes approach
                        the bass range. It also always plays at a fortissimo
                        dynamic, which means to play very loudly. On the other
                        hand, the pleading voice has a range from high C to the
                        C the octave above that, which approximates the range of
                        a soprano. It also plays piano, or softly. So I think
                        this is a fair representation of that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to the music, both use the same melodic
                        idea, the rising-falling motif: this idea occurs both in
                        the higher register and in the lower register, but
                        slightly altered and with the harmonies filled in. On
                        the left hand, we have a chromatically descending bass:
                        while the bass is usually punctuated by the fortissimo
                        chords, which obscure the descent somewhat, it is very
                        clear from bars 7 to 8, when it constantly descends as
                        it is counterbalanced by the ascending right hand until
                        the melody peaks at bar 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In bars 9 and 10, the music thins significantly, with
                        many dramatic pauses: the left hand comes down octave by
                        octave and pulls the right hand down with it. In the
                        second half of measure 10, we get a soft chromatic scale
                        running down 2 octaves (this scale is not supposed to be
                        showy nor virtuosic, but rather deflationary, according
                        to James) until we reach the A flat, and proceed to
                        resolve to the Allegro. Note that the transition between
                        the 2 parts is sudden, without pause: contrast is one of
                        the hallmarks of a Beethoven Sonata, and here the
                        contrast would be between tempos, as elsewhere it may be
                        with the dynamics.

                        The allegro begins with the first theme, what is
                        referred to as a "Mannheim Rocket": a huge, ascending,
                        arpeggio continuously going upwards and upwards until it
                        reaches its peak 2 octaves later. This technique
                        features prominently in the Mannheim school of
                        composition: a notable example would be with the finale
                        of Mozart's 40th Symphony. However, while the natural
                        tendency would be to crescendo over the upward run,
                        Beethoven instructs the performer to play softly– this
                        evokes the feeling of tension rather than a violent
                        outburst, albeit those will invariably come later. After
                        running up for some 4 bars, it begins to sink back down,
                        loudening more and more until the repetition of the
                        phrase. This 8-bar phrase composes the first theme of
                        the sonata, and we will be playing around with it more a
                        little bit later. For convenience, I will call this
                        Theme 1.1.

                    <p>
                        Now, I think it's somewhat important for me to mention
                        the left hand: it is playing notes with a tremolo
                        effect, rapidly moving from one note to the other. This
                        is yet another unpianistic effect in this sonata:
                        tremolos are very easy to do on the violin, viola,
                        cello, and other string instruments (and are considered
                        basic techniques on those instruments), but are
                        significantly more difficult on the piano, where effort
                        is required to develop a tremolo that is soft, smooth,
                        and musical.

                        We now move on to the next few bars. Here, we have
                        sforzando octaves over a piano accompaniment, giving it
                        the quality of a declaration or a flash of thunder,
                        before the right hand tumbles down in a virtuosic
                        arpeggio. This is repeated twice before we begin to
                        transition to the next part of the exposition using the
                        first theme, stated above. Some sources state that this
                        part constitutes a second "first theme" or perhaps a
                        "subsidiary theme", while others state that this is just
                        a connecting passage: I am more inclined to believe that
                        it is not a theme, but rather a connecting passage, but
                        each person can come away from this piece with a very
                        different conclusion.

                    <p>
                        After that, we have yet more recurrences of theme 1.1,
                        sightly modified, this time without the descending tail:
                        instead, it ascends higher and higher, pulled down by
                        sforzando chords every 4 bars. Given that the second
                        theme ends in G minor, the dominant of C, we have a rise
                        in G major from bars 35 to 37, a rise in A-flat major
                        from bars 39 to 41, and a rise in B-flat major from bars
                        43 to 45, readying for a possible second theme in E-flat
                        major.

                        Nope! It turns out the second theme is instead in E-flat
                        minor, which, while sharing the same root as E-flat
                        major or being "parallel" to it, is different— it still
                        sounds sad, especially when compared to the next few
                        parts. This harmonic surprise, no matter how small,
                        reveals 2 things that will recur in Beethoven's works:
                        the first would be the quick switch between the major
                        and the parallel minor, and the second would be the
                        harmonic surprises that constantly recur in his works
                        and capture the attention of the listener. For
                        convenience, I will refer to this theme as theme 2.1:
                        the first theme of the second theme group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to the music itself, it is also more
                        orchestral than pianistic: this is obviated by the
                        constant hand-crossings in the right hand, which is
                        evidenced by the (also constant) clef changes. This
                        gives it the effect of a duet, with a bass voice around
                        low C or in the octave above C3 and a soprano voice
                        around high C or in the octave above C5. Furthermore,
                        the soprano voice is heavily ornamented, with sforzando
                        accents and grace notes embellishing the highest note in
                        the upward arpeggio and mordents ornamenting the
                        downward staccato runs. This, combined with the held
                        note-chord-chord-chord accompaniment and the instruction
                        to play softly give it a more light and elegant quality
                        in the hands of a skillful pianist. I think this is the
                        right time to mention the fact that the instruction
                        "sforzando" means different things in different
                        contexts: in a forte context, it can mean to play
                        fortississimo, but in a piano context, it can mean just
                        playing mezzo-piano or just with an accent, a sentiment
                        also echoed by Schiff. So I believe this is a good place
                        to have softer sforzandos as compared to the previous
                        themes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From bars 51 to 62, we stay in the tonality of an E-flat
                        minor, doing either sforzandos or mordents. In bar 63,
                        we begin to move to D-flat major and restate the second
                        theme. After that, in bar 75, we remove the sforzandi in
                        the soprano (moving them instead to the base) and use
                        the mordent tail of the theme to modulate through to
                        E-flat minor, F minor, C minor, B-flat major, and then
                        back to E-flat major, according to James.

                        Here, we have another theme, this time in E-flat major,
                        which is the relative major of C-major (so called
                        because it has the same number of flats and sharps as
                        the minor). Of course, sources disagree whether this is
                        a third theme or part of the second theme group— but for
                        convenience, I'll just mark this as theme 2.2, the
                        second theme of the second theme group. Editors of
                        Wikipedia state that this theme is very much like an
                        <span
                            title="[a bass which has a low note, then a high note, then a middle note, then a high note, repeated over and over again]"

                        >
                        It begins at the home tone of E-flat major with the bass
                        figures in the inner voices, and stays mostly still for
                        some 4 bars: it then moves up quarter-note by
                        quarter-note with the right hand and left hand moving in
                        contrary motion, crescendoing until it reaches the
                        e-flat an octave up. After this, we get 2 forte broken
                        chords, much like an orchestral tutti, representing an
                        IV-V-I cadence (a type of cadence that begins on the 4th
                        scale degree, goes to the 5th or the dominant, and back
                        to the 1st or the tonic: this is a very common cadence),
                        bringing us back down for the pattern to be repeated or
                        leading to the next part.

                        We now reach a large, virtuosic run down from the
                        double-high E-flat to the G in the middle range. Unlike
                        the previous connecting passage, this does not use
                        arpeggios to reach downwards but instead uses scales,
                        which prolongs the descent for much longer: and on the
                        left hand, we have an I-vi-IV-V chord progression, a
                        common chordal system not only in classical music but
                        also in pop music as is explained by Longdon (2019).
                        However, in Beethoven's hands, we also get some
                        variation, as in the repeat of this part the chords
                        change from the held note-chord pattern to an
                        octave-chord pattern, in ever-more descending ranges.
                        Musicians argue whether this theme is cadential, meaning
                        its only function is to end the piece, or whether it is
                        theme 2.3: I'll just side with Kumar (2017), as
                        previously, on this topic and call it the cadential
                        theme. After that, we repeat theme 1.1 in the key of
                        E-flat, as with theme 2.2, and go to the repeat (which I
                        have omitted from the discussion, for the sake of
                        brevity).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But now, the question asked previously comes into play:
                        Is the Grave an introduction, or is it part of the
                        exposition? If you believe that the Grave is only part
                        of the introduction, the repeat will only go back to the
                        Allegro, which would be the top of the exposition. The
                        first edition agrees with this view, placing the repeat
                        sign at the tempo marking, and this is the view
                        predominantly taken by most pianists. However, if you
                        believe that the Grave is part of the exposition, you
                        would instead repeat back to the top of the entire
                        piece, essentially lengthening the first movement to
                        dwarf the other 2 movements. This makes the size of the
                        first movement comparable to the size of the second and
                        third combined, and is the view taken by such pianists
                        as Andras Schiff (who is a primary source for this
                        essay) and by Rudolf Serkin. But regardless of your
                        opinion on this matter, you would then repeat through
                        all the previous sections and go back here, and then
                        proceed to the beginning of the development.

                        As previously stated, the development is when we begin

                        different harmonies and key colors. As a short review,
                        there are five themes: the introductory theme, theme
                        1.1, theme 2.1, theme 2.2, and the cadential theme.

                        The development, interestingly, does not begin straight
                        away with the themes but instead goes back to the Grave
                        and restates the fortepiano chords. This restatement of
                        the introduction, along with the restatement later on
                        close to the Coda, is unique to this piece— James states
                        that this reminds us of the aggrieved context to which
                        the Allegro is a response. In any case, it begins in G
                        minor in bar 133 and it moves up to E-flat in the next:
                        but instead of moving up again in bar 135, it stays on
                        E-flat and uses its
                        <span
                            title="[meaning same note: E-flat and D-sharp are the same note]"
                            >enharmonic</span
                        >
                        quality to D-sharp to move to E minor. This usage of
                        enharmonic notes is by no means unique to this piece: a
                        similar occurrence happens with the Appassionata Sonata,
                        which is studied in depth in the dissertation thesis of
                        Reale (2019).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, before continuing, I believe we ought to note the
                        fact that we have moved to E minor, a key with 1 sharp,
                        from C minor, a key with 3 flats: these 2 keys are very
                        far away from each other, and so this is a real harmonic
                        surprise. Beethoven's ability to bring us to keys very
                        far away from the home key and back in a very natural
                        way is something that recurs in all of his sonatas, not
                        just this one: I will try to point out this unique
                        occurrence whenever we see it. But onwards we go, to the
                        development!

                        We begin with Theme 1.1, the Mannheim Rocket, in the key
                        of E minor— the same key that we modulated to in the
                        introductory passage earlier. However, this time, it is
                        accompanied by a great crescendo, which gives it a more
                        agitated and explosive character than the more
                        restrained versions we have heard earlier. After this,
                        we have the introductory rising-falling theme, also in E
                        minor, played piano or softly. James remarks that this
                        gives us the 2 views of suffering: there is the
                        agitated, fighting side, and the depressed, suffering
                        side of pathos— a wild swing that the sonata reflects
                        with its themes. The combination of these motives is
                        repeated, this time in the key of D major, which gives
                        it a slightly more desperate feeling as it sinks lower.

                        We now continue with the roles of the hands reversed:
                        this time, the left hand is playing a reduced version of
                        Theme 1.1, without the tail and without the lower voice,
                        as the right hand plays the tremolos that used to be in
                        the bass. Even as the left hand tries to go up and up
                        and up, the music overall chromatically descends: each
                        motif is that of a descending semitone, and the tremolos
                        descend every 4 bars from B-flat to A and then to
                        A-flat. After 12 bars of this relative stability, the
                        tremolos begin to fall and fall from the G in the middle
                        register down to the B of the double-low register,
                        nearly 2 octaves in span. As with many of the
                        developments of Beethoven in minor keys, this passage is
                        very unstable and very chromatic, with unclear harmonies
                        wafting in the air.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe this is now a good time to take a closer look
                        at Theme 1.1, and the reduction of it given here. The
                        reduction here only has the top notes of the theme, and
                        we can see that it descends by a semitone every 2 notes:
                        if we look back at the modified statement of Theme 1.1
                        that was used to connect to Theme 2.1, we see that it is
                        always composed of a descending semitone somewhere in
                        the chord: this is not wholly audible, however, because
                        there is always an ascending semitone as well, and the
                        lower and upper voice trade-off these parts. When it is
                        isolated and purified, as here, we see that it is built
                        off a device that James states is used to convey weeping
                        or suffering. However, I would remark that while it may
                        convey a more doleful air when slowed down, I believe
                        that when sped up to be this fast, it gives a feeling
                        more of thinned anger and small, pinpoint bursts that do
                        nothing to abate it rather than of sorrow.

                        Now, if we look at the sheet music, we're only around
                        halfway through the development: 5 lines have passed,
                        and there are still 5 lines left to go. But in reality,
                        we have reached the dominant: if you can read the first
                        note of the tremolo, it is clear that the note is G,
                        which is the dominant of C. It is also in a tremolo in
                        the left hand, which makes it a tremolo drone, which
                        gives it a similar status to that of an organ-point, of
                        a long held-note in the left hand. In the classical
                        period, this would signal the end of the development:
                        for example, in Mozart's A minor piano sonata, K. 310,
                        the dominant stays only for 6 measures before resolving
                        back to the recapitulation. Indeed, one of Beethoven's
                        hallmarks would have been his ability to extend the
                        dominant tone for very long periods of time, and it is a
                        pattern that we will see later on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to the music itself, we see that it is
                        composed of two four-bar phrases. The first has low
                        arpeggios, very close to the tremolos in the left hand,
                        played at a pianissimo level or very quietly. These
                        arpeggios are very unstable, and they move chromatically
                        up and down, unable to decide which chord to strike: if
                        we identify pathos, as suffering and rage, this is
                        certainly on the suffering, depressed, wavering side.
                        The second phrase has a modified, 2-bar form of Theme
                        1.1 shoot upwards from middle E to double-high E: unlike
                        the modified forms of theme 1.1 as we have seen them
                        earlier, though, this form has a descending tail, in
                        this case composed of a trill. Here, the trill is used
                        more in a classical sense, of being used to resolve back
                        to the G: however, in later sonatas, Beethoven would use
                        the trill in more unique and unusual ways, especially in
                        his late-period sonatas with the Hammerklavier. This
                        form of the Mannheim rocket is accompanied by a
                        crescendo all the way up to the loud sforzando at the
                        top of the phrase, which gives it the angered nature of
                        pathos. These 2 phrases are repeated twice before
                        Beethoven focuses on the trilled ending and uses a huge
                        downward scale, reminiscent of the cadential theme, to
                        reach the C in the very lowest register of the old
                        fortepianos. And thus, we move to the recapitulation!

                    <p>
                        Now, something that may not have been obvious when I
                        introduced Sonata Form on the landing page would be the
                        fact that it is not only the second theme but also the
                        first theme that changes. The recapitulation is not just
                        a restatement of the theme, especially not in
                        Beethoven’s time when thematic development was king:
                        instead, we see how the Development section, how the
                        battle between little fragments of the theme and big
                        fragments of the theme in all different keys affects the
                        motifs when they come out of the blender. In this case,
                        I think the entire recapitulation is now dripped and
                        soaked in the pathos that permeated the development:
                        every theme is now in a minor key, all dripped with the
                        sorrow and anguish expressed in the development. And so,
                        we begin with the first theme.

                    <p>
                        In this case, Theme 1.1 is repeated twice, without any
                        changes to its structure in the first repetition.
                        However, in the second repetition, we get an entirely
                        different tail of the theme: instead of remaining in C
                        minor, as the head does, it modulates to D flat major on
                        the first fall, E flat minor on the second fall, and
                        then finally to F minor on the third fall, when it
                        prepares to move on to the next theme. Now, there are 2
                        things to note here: the first would be that the passage
                        of a sudden sforzando chord with a falling arpeggio that
                        occurred in the exposition has disappeared, which is a
                        significant indicator that it is not a theme but rather
                        just a passage or at best a “subsidiary theme”, as per
                        James. The other thing to note is the way the first
                        theme transitions to the second: while in the
                        exposition, we used the head of the theme to transition,
                        going from G to A-flat to B-flat, we now use the tail of
                        the theme to transition from C to D-flat to E-flat,
                        which gives us a very pleasing symmetry: both have
                        rising roots, but the exact way these are expressed
                        changes. Indeed, music analysis gives us insight into
                        the hidden workings of a piece in ways that are
                        difficult to determine on the first pass. Regardless, we
                        now move on:

                        We now have the second theme. But wait— it’s not in C
                        minor, but instead it’s in F minor! This is a smaller
                        harmonic surprise, albeit F minor and C minor are far
                        more related (F is the subdominant of C) rather than the
                        E flat major and C minor of previously. And indeed,
                        after the first statement of Theme 2.1 in F minor over
                        bars 221 to 229, it begins modulating to C minor over
                        bars 229 to 232 and settles the second half of the theme
                        in bar 233, or the second line, 6th bar from the right.
                        It now stays in C minor, the expected key, until bar 245
                        when uses the mordent tail of the second theme to
                        modulate to F, and then to B flat, then E flat, then A
                        flat, then takes advantage of the neighboring tone to
                        move right back to G— preparing us for Theme 2.2, in the
                        key of C-minor.

                        Theme 2.2 is slightly unusual in that it is not just a
                        direct transposition of the theme into the key of C
                        minor: instead, while the beginning and end are changed
                        to align more with the minor tonality, the middle itself
                        is directly copied from the first statement in the
                        exposition. If we look at the first 4 bars when the
                        theme is stable, both the right hand and the left hand
                        move away from the C-minor Alberti bass and pull
                        outwards: thus, when the contrary motion begins in bar
                        257 or in the first line, 5th bar, we see that the right
                        hand jumps to e natural and the left hand goes up rather
                        than down to b-flat to mimic more the statement of the
                        theme in the exposition. This makes it significantly
                        more interesting as compared to a direct transposition,
                        which I feel sounds fairly bland with the repeated
                        C-minor chords. Furthermore, instead of changing on the
                        second repeat of this theme, it instead repeats it
                        perfectly: maybe this is already because it was good
                        enough to transition to the next material, which is also
                        in C minor. With respect to the music itself, instead of
                        the glorious and hopeful feeling that was evoked with
                        the E-flat major phrase earlier (E-flat major is often
                        associated with heroic music, like Tchaikovsky’s 1812
                        Overture or Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony), we get an
                        anticipatory phrase, threatening the possibility of
                        danger with the minor melody humming over a minor
                        background: a danger that closens with every note.

                        We now move on to the cadential theme, which is also in
                        C minor: its light and airy quality are still present,
                        but now tinged with the pathos that permeates the
                        recapitulation. After it tumbles down from the
                        double-high C to the middle E-flat twice, we get a
                        repetition of Theme 1.1, this time with the player
                        shouting at forte, until we reach 2 fortissimo
                        diminished seventh chords— a type of chord, built on the
                        seventh scale degree (e.g. in the key of C major, the
                        note is B), that has a lot of dissonance because of the
                        tritone that serves as its building block. Both of those
                        chords signal the end of the recapitulation and the
                        beginning of the coda.

                        For the third or fourth time, depending on whether you
                        repeated the Grave as stated above, we have another slow
                        passage. But instead of being punctuated by the
                        forte-piano chords which signal the tonality of the
                        motif, we get dead silence: an extraordinarily dramatic
                        silence, in any case. Gone now are the dissonant shouts
                        and refusals, and what is left is the soft, suffocated,
                        depressed rising-falling motif. This now begins by using
                        the material in the third bar of the introduction, of a
                        cadence from F sharp, diminished seventh, to G-minor.
                        Then we move up by a fourth to another rising falling
                        passage, moving from B, diminished seventh, to C minor.
                        Lastly, we get another diminished seventh chord, but the
                        phrase stops before it is able to resolve and instead
                        sinks down and down and down until it reaches the
                        double-low octave and moves without pause to the ending.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the Grave, we get one last recurrence of the theme
                        in its original form: starting from a soft piano, it
                        ascends as softly as it did in the exposition. But
                        instead of descending, as with the exposition, it stays
                        up and crescendos to fortissimo with the bass descending
                        chromatically. And thus the movement is finished: with 5
                        fortissimo block chords, shaking the fortepiano of
                        Beethoven’s day and even some modern pianos, and
                        concluding with the final, perfect v-i cadence.

                    <p>
                        Even this early in Beethoven’s music, we already begin
                        to see the hallmarks of his playing: an extended
                        development and coda, extended dominant preparation,
                        stark contrasts between the loud and soft, the ability
                        to modulate from nearby keys to far away and then back
                        home, and the motivic economy. Each of these facets
                        plays a greater and greater role as Beethoven matures
                        and enters his middle and late periods: each will be
                        transformed in new ways as he produces monumental work
                        after monumental work. But even so, I believe it is a
                        worthwhile endeavor to study the young Beethoven so that
                        when we see his middle and late works, we will have the
                        context to be able to say whether it is new, or whether
                        it is a developed form of something that appeared
                        earlier on. Thank you for reading!
